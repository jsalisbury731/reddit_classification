Men seem to shit themselves a lot. What's up with that?,"I'm sorry but it seems like almost every man I've known has had a story of them shitting themselves. I've never even come close to that happening. I'm sure women wouldn't be excited to share such a story but the women I'm close to agree that they've never even come close as well. They always made it to the toilet even in an emergency. Do men just have more sensitive bowels? 

I also hear stories of guys farting and accidentally shitting themselves. Are you guys okay? Is this strictly a man problem? 

My cousin once shit himself on his way to work and had to call his brother to bring him a change of clothes. That was definitely the worst version of it happening I've ever heard but there are countless others.

The only time I hear of this happening to women is during a certain sexual act. What's up with that?",Waterlou25,AskMen

How do I not come off as too eager after the first date?,"M25 just went on a first date with a girl F23. Went to dinner and walked around the city for a bit afterwards and then I left. We hit it off pretty well and we’re trying to plan a 2nd date around our schedules. 

However, this is where I usually screw things up in the past. I’ve been single for damn near my whole life and I’m very ready to look to settle down. I don’t need to get married next month or anything, but want someone to do stuff with, travel with, etc. And hopefully it leads to a relationship. 

So, since I’ve been single for a long time, previous girls I’ve went out with only lasted that one date because whenever I start to like a girl, I want just talk to them all the time. And be with them. But I know that’s why things didn’t work out with previous girls. 

And with this girl, I can feel those same bad habits starting to make their way into my thought process. And I really don’t want to screw this up. I feel like we could go on multiple dates but between this first and 2nd date, I want to make sure I’m doing it smooth, and don’t screw things up prematurely.

How bad is it to lust heavily towards others while in a relationship?,"I love my girlfriend with all my heart, we both adore each other, our relationship is great and I would never cheat on her and when it comes to our sex life things are generally ok.

Guys who have had a FWB relationship- how weird would it be if I texted my ex FWB?,"We met 4 years ago in college in class. I am 25 now. The extent of our relationship was friends with benefits for about a year and a half. Our texts were always far and few in between. Last time I saw him, I had told him I really liked him. He told me he was not ready to be in a relationship and figured I also only wanted a FWB relationship. After that, we never talked again.

That last night , before I confessed that I liked him, I thought he was going to reciprocate the same feelings to me. I got mixed signals from him. When a guy likes me, it's pretty obvious. So too when a guy doesn't like me. He fell in between. One drunken night, he told me he ""loved me."" Maybe, I didn't realize how drunk he was. Another time, he told me he wanted to take me on a real date and go to the movies. That never happened. I guess I was naive and wanted to believe so badly that he liked me.

It's been 2 years since that night and I have not stopped thinking about him. I can't shake the idea that we will are just never going to talk ever again.

Texting for 6 months - how do I know I (23F) have scared him (23F) off?,"Been messaging an old school friend for 6 months after matching on a dating app. Honestly, the best dates I have been on in years! But due to Covid, we’ve only met up 5 times in that period. This week, he organised for us to go to a nice restaurant, and then he drove me home... car was faulty but both just about made it home (to our own houses).

Now here’s the thing, during these ‘dates’ I feel like I have been very obviously flirting, but he’s never made a move. I know he isn’t very experienced with women, so I figured he just needed more time. Well I got home, and he text to say he got home safe, and then I sent the risky text to say I had wanted to kiss him that evening. He replied saying that if it hadn’t of been for the car, then he would have gone for it. 

Since then he has barely messaged, so now I’m worried I rushed him still, and he feels pressurised to kiss me next time we see each other. Or perhaps he felt pressured to even say he wanted to kiss me too?

How do I (M19) explain to my friend (M19) why I hate going to the gym?,"Basically that ^

To start I should probably explain that this guy is like the polar opposite of me, good looking, extroverted, insane sex life, the works - the only thing I think we have in common is liking men 🙄

I have like a massive fear of going to the gym, I can think of nothing more terrifying (except maybe spiders).

The whole exercising thing isn't my forte, the only reason I lost 2 stone was purely by accident, and exercising in front of people is a big fear (stemming from some real shitty experiences when a kid etc.). I not only lost far but like almost any muscle I had. 

I can barely run or jog without some form of massive worry that everybody else there is judging both my technique, and how shitty my looks are.

And as for any form of weights? That's just as bad - I can barely squat 15 kg. And all I can ever think of is that I somehow used to be able to deadlift 100kg just from like farm work. 

Then to top it all I seem to have some form of SAD which genuinely fucks me up mentally most of winter and start of spring. 

I have literally no idea how to explain this to my guy friend, who is the lost extroverted person I know (that literally deadlift/throw my entire body weight across a room) and is like permenately happy and the polar opposite of me.

The idea of actually saying this in person is like horrifying - I don't want to break his bubble where he can only see the world as some fuckin good place where introverts don't exist - and I'd probably just stutter on every other friggin word... 

I'm sure he'd be proper weirded out if he clocked how much of an introvert I actually am.

Problem is we supposed to go to prom together but every time I bring it up she acts cold and brushes it off so I'm not even sure if we still going together.

"Straight redditors: What do you mean when you say your SO must be ""smart""?","Alright. Here me out. I frequently read posts about what men are looking for in women and the list usually goes like this: ""My ideal gf/wife is absolutely gorgeous, she's funny, smart, outgoing, faithful, feminine, likes to clean/tidy up..."", among other things. And all of it sounds great! I believe I have a good understanding of why men look for these qualities, but the ""smart"" thing always leaves me wondering. You might think ""well, that's pretty self-explanatory, you genius"", but I still wonder what most men mean by that. Are you looking for someone with a master's degree? Someone who speaks multiple languages? Someone who can use a calculator? Someone who knows all the world's capitals? A couple of my friends end up enlisting these things when they talk about a new girl they just met, like: ""Yeah, she's awesome, super hot, funny, she's smart, and likes videogames!"" Like... ok O.o

This stems from the other side of the coin... Posts like ""I love my gf, but she's dumb as a rock."" What do you mean by that?! ""Dumb"" as in doing what? She doesn't know how to make coffee? She doesn't understand sarcasm? She doesn't have a PhD? WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE?",NageleRules,AskMen

deodorant stains that are long streaks when putting on t shirts?,"hey guys! so i noticed that sometimes when i put on a new t shirt or a freshly laundered t shirt, after i put it on i will have random white streaks along the torso or back or the sides. i am not talking about pit stains or deodoant in the pits it seems to get everywhere. this even also happens when i dont even wear deodorant.

what i assume is happening is that after i shower my pits have wet deodorant on them or when i put on my shirt that deodorant somehow hits the shirt and when i put it on it makes a streak.

&amp;#x200B;

its really annoying cuz then i always have to rub them out or clean them out. what am i doing wrong btw? like does this happen to any of you? i assume its deodorant nothing else makes sense and if so i guess my plan of action is to

1. properly wash with body soap my pits to remove anything. 
2. put on shirt
3. now apply deodorant

rather then applying deodorant first and then shirt

hope that makes sense

However, one acquaintance in common, whenever sees us together in our common places brings up or asks me about girls which just happen to be my friends and I was occasionally seen taking coffee or something like that.

To this point it feels like this person does not want to give me a fair shot with the girl and the situation is kinda getting out of hands since I don't like to justify myself when I am just saying the truth -like not man, she is just a friend-, but I happen to be terribly worried of her having a bad image of me since I do care this time.

Why doesn’t my boyfriend care about my pleasure?,"Hi guys, I have a bit of a predicament and I was hoping you could help me.

I (23F) have been dating my bf (33M) for about 2 1/2 years now. He is the most loving, giving, affectionate man in every aspect besides sex.  I know that he loves having sex with me..but he only wants to have sex like once a week..barely.  For instance the last time we had sex was over two weeks ago, and then I got my period. Towards the end of my period I gave him a REALLY good blow job. Last night, I was joking around and said how horny I was bc we hadn’t had sex in two weeks..he turned and looked at me and said, “yes we did, you gave me a bj a few days ago” !!!!!

The main problem is that he never ever goes down on me or fingers me beyond like shoving his fingers in me to get me ready for sex.  During sex it’s like he forgets that I need my clit stimulated so the only time I cum is when I’m on top. I was insecure about this for a long time that maybe I taste bad or something, but it can’t be because my ex’s before would beg me to sit on their face. And I would cum in every single position. My bf is older than me and more dominant so when I do try and tell him what to do, I feel like it’s a turn off for him. 

Anytime I bring this up to him it’s like a blow to his ego. I try not bringing it up and try things like, dressing up sexy which I did two nights ago. We even bought rope and some cuffs to play with and haven’t even opened it yet. That was 2 months ago. But nothing seems to work. At the end of the day this leaves me feeling incredibly worthless and like he doesn’t care about my pleasure. Is he clueless? Insecure? Hates me? Lol pls help.

Am not sure how i feel anymore,"
Am in the late thirties, not soft in real life by any mean and here is a part of me i want to share with u. 

Its started 9 years ago. I met her in a bar were she was working. I couldn’t take my eyes off here. Asked her out and later she handed over her number and then we started dating. 

We spent together 1.5 years. I loved her so much. I knew back then it was the one, you know the one love comes in ur life only once. I was getting stomach butterflies every time i was seeing her. I have done things in my life i never thought i would ever do because of her. The problem is, she was so pretty. I mean very pretty to the point anyone sees her they can’t stop complementing her beauty. That includes women too. 
Tbh it was exhausting, i mean i start to get jealous. And she was the kinds of flirty person. I remember She opened up to me one night while we were drunk and said that’s part of her culture and this how women keep the man interested. But it was too much for me as it affected my trust in her at some point. 

During the time we were together i declared to her how am serious about us. I let her meet my sister as she was living in a nearby city(we both expats).  I talked with her about parenting and how much i really love kids and i wish they look like her. I did everything i could to make her happy. And i mean literary everything i could from time/care/traveling/money/etc. things were going normal with ups and downs like any relationship. 

One day my work asked me to go on a business trip for 3 months. Deep down i know that it will be a very difficult time specially after the last few weeks as she lost her job and she wasn’t sure about what she want do for living. 

So i left and we were texting/talking like almost everyday. Exactly after 2 weeks i called her and i was checking how she feels because she was so down looking for a job and failing in a lot of interviews, then she said she is with her friend and she will go to sleep because she is so tired. For some reason i called again later that night and when she answered she said she is with some people in car and going somewhere to party. At that time she had no money (i gave her some and rented a place for her) and she was suppose to prepare for an interview the next day. 

That was the moment i realized that she can’t take responsibilities. I felt i was caring too much. I was giving too much without much in return. I know this is how most people describe love but I didn’t really feel i was fair to myself. If she didn’t care about herself then what am doing then. So i broke up with her at that call. 

My birthday was exactly after 1 week from that call. I was hoping from the bottom of my heart that things gets better. She texted me: MYNAME! 
That’s it. And i never heard from her again or saw single text. 

I won’t lie to you. It broke me to pieces although it was my decision. I lost a piece of me back then. She left and took something with her that after all this years am not able to get back. 

I tried to make my self busy. Tried to learn how to play music and it didn’t work out. Then i started doing photography and i realized everyone is telling me that my pictures are great and different and i should consider photography as a thing in my life. From there i learned how to do it professionally and i became one of the best photographer in town(glamour and beauty). I met a lot of beautiful/hot girls. I went to parties and i had a lot of connections easily. Photography was a way for me to sink myself into a new life. I didn’t do it as a full time job although everyone was telling me to. But i didn’t want to sacrifice my career (i have a decent one) and i kept it as a hobby and enjoyment of making something beautiful. 

During that period i had an open relationship with someone. We agreed that it’s just a casual thing and i made myself clear that am not looking for anything serious or a relationship. She agreed and It went ok for a year and unfortunately the girl has developed emotion during that period and she start to make future plans for us so i decided to end it before it gets even worth as I didn’t want to hurt her(although i know i did). I didn’t feel anything towards her. I felt like am dead inside with every girl i met over the years. I was even usually  using alcohol (I couldn’t with it) whenever am spending a night with anyone to enjoy my time and feel good. 

I decided i will stop photography and all these relationship thing and focus about my work. I became less social. I lost some of my friends as i don’t party anymore. And the other ones either left the country or moved to another city(yeah welcome to the expat’s life, sucks).  I don’t enjoy the booz anymore (u know signs of getting old). And things went super quit in my life. 

Till one day 2 years back i got a very long message from my ex (first one i talked about) mentioning how grateful she is towards everything i did for her and how she admires every moment we spent together from anger to true love and in conclusion she wanted to thank me for everything things i did for her and apologize if she ever did hurt me. 

Tbh the moment i got the message i though i would react differently but i was ok. Seems that i was over her! or i forgot about her! or my mind couldn’t process it! Tbh am not really sure. Anyhow i texted her back thanking her and ask if she still in town we might go for a coffee as it’s been so many years. And her answer confused me till today: she said that she don’t think it’s a good idea plus she is in a relationship and she doesn’t want to tell her boyfriend that she is going to meet her ex for a coffee. I replied i understand and take care. 

I know it’s really a very long rant and i know a lot of people might not understand and feel it the same way i do as there is so many to say and tell in between but that would be too long for a post on Reddit. But i have been going through my past in the last few months (thanks covid)trying to sort my thoughts and see the mistakes i have done in my life so i don’t repeat them or at least i reach to a point to know how i can make my life better and happier. 

My ex image extensively is been hunting me recently and every time it comes up i really don’t know where its coming from. And the message i got from her 2 years back keep raising questions i have no answer for. Did she mean anything by that? Am i still doomed and living in her memories and the past? Why her profile pic is still the pic i took 8 years back ? Can i get the old me again please? I miss feeling things the way they used to feel. 

Please forgive me, first for my English as its not my main language and second for this long post.  I really needed to get this out of my chest. I couldn’t tell this to the people i know. And I couldn’t even post this from my real account. I hope a word from someone here might heal a wound I couldn’t fix over the years or might let me see something am not able to see.",amNotMeAnymore,AskMen

Why would my (24F) boyfriend (31M) be comfortable talking about our future kids but is uncomfortable talking about marriage?,"Been together a year and 9 months. Wants kids with me.

His reasoning is it's too expensive. I said I don't want a big wedding. Just a small get together. And I also said I'm not buying a house with someone I'm not legally binded with.

By the way, I always wanted to be childfree until last year. I was distant in the beginning of our relationship. He's the one that brings up kids and forever. So I'm not pushing this stuff on him.

[NSFW] How do I get over performance anxiety with my partner?,"When we first began in our relationship, me and my SO had a really great sex life. I would have no issues but then, We got into a pretty tight situation in terms of finance, comfort and other things that made life a living hell. Our romantic relationship has stayed the same, however, it was just that everything else really sucked. Due to that, I began to get really stressed and sex began to diminish bit by bit. One when we had sex almost every day, it became something of like once a week. Later it was like 1 every 10 days and so on. There would be days in which we tried to have sex and I didn’t feel it. I would not get an erection. There were times in which I would get it but I would lose it really fast. Other times my erection wasn’t strong enough. My partner understood that we were going through a rough time and we didn’t think of it at all. However, now that we are fine in terms of comfort and everything I am still blocked internally.  We are in a good position and I still don’t understand why is it that I am still like this. Now it is even worse because when we try to have sex, I immediately think of the times I couldn’t perform and that causes me anxiety and I can’t get it up. I don’t know what is wrong with me.
