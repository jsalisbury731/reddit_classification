Germany and hitch-hiking?,"When I was going to uni I often picked up hitch hikers, many where German, when going from uni to home and vice versa, as these two cities were a common 'path' many tourists followed, and a good portion of the backpackers were German.

Some asked directly why it's so easy to get a lift in Australia and said how in Germany hitch hiking isn't a thing? It's easier for girls to hitch-hike as they get picked up by both blokes trying to crack on, and they are seen as less menacing and thus women drivers will be more likely to give them a lift) but I picked up guys, couples, whoever, and they said that usually the longest they have had to wait is 10 minutes before someone stops.

I wondered if this was because these were German's usually from the city and the region I live in is a tourist attraction as while it has some cities, it's mainly pristine nature and they have come here to hike or kayak in places that look the same as they would have looked for the last 1,000 years kind of thing, and the people that live in areas where their is little public transport (now it's tourism industry has grown there are buses) but growing up a lot of the time unless the person 'looked unsafe', it was unpolite to not give someone a ride if you were going to where they needed to get to but they didn't have car... even if they were a stranger!",TryToDoGoodTA,germany

Tax on UK rental earnings,"In 2016 &amp; 1017 I earned a full time wage in Germany (42k)

"University student moving into his own apartment, trying to be mindful of neighbors with my hobby. What are the rules/laws governing sound?","hey guys

So I'm moving out of home and into my own apartment in order to start my studies. I play a certain rhythm game for fun very often, and it uses a specialized controller. It can get rather loud, as it consists of me hitting the buttons heavily which creates a relatively loud ""thack"" sound.

Here's a video demonstrating the sound: https://youtu.be/NNT2CpUOupw?t=28

Anyway, I know it can get loud, and I want to try and be mindful to my neighbors so as to not disturb them. How can I approach this problem? I've looked a bit into soundproofing and thought of those foam pads you see on the walls of every YouTuber's room, but apparently they only really ""absorb"" sound and doesn't contain it. I've also read that I can legally be as loud as I want until around 10pm on any day of the week, is this true?

How realistic is it to successfully self-finance your Studium here?,"Not sure if already asked, I have searched but couldn't find anything.  
To preface: I'm Asian, studying Bachelor, can speak okay-ish German.  
So far financially my study here has been a mixture of supports from my parents and a 450 Minijob. Recently I have been thinking a lot about whether I can work enough to completely pay everything by myself and no longer be financially dependent. My family, while not yet completely broke, is suffering from financial hardship at the moment.  
I have lurked into the Wiki here and found the following info:  
""While everyone's financial needs and earning potential is different, broadly speaking, you should not expect to cover more than about half of your total expenses (assuming you're studying at a public university) through working - the other half will have to come from somewhere else (savings, contributions from family, etc).""

""Minimum wage in Germany (in 2019) is 9.19 € / hr, and many typical ""student"" jobs (particularly those which don't require a specific qualification) pay minimum wage. 70 hours a month at minimum wage pays 643 € / month gross. People who earn more than a 450 € (the Minijob, above) must pay social insurance premiums, which, in this case, are about 80 €, giving a net salary of 560 € / month.

In order to earn 853 € a month net (what the German government considers to be the minimum required to survive as a student) while working 70 hours a month, a student would have to earn around 950 € gross, which is an hourly wage of around 13.50 €. To cover a more realistic average cost of 920 € / month, a student would have to earn around 1050 € / month gross, or 15 € / hour.""

If the above calculations are correct, I feel like my only option is to get a Werkstudent job? Since apparently even if I work full 80 hours a month at McDonald or something like that I can only get around 650€ at best. I can't imagine any kind of ""low-skilled"" jobs that pay more than 12/hour.

So I really hope anyone of you that has successfully covered your study here on their own, please tell me your story (what jobs you did and how did you find it, etc.). Plus point if you are non-EU like me :p

Also side questions to Germans: is it common that German students completely financially independent on their parents in their Studium?",cnb1998,germany

"Cross Border Directive and Living in Germany, Working in Ireland","Hi,

I am confused by the law and bureaucracy around the cross border directive and hope someone here can help.

I am currently working in Ireland and will continue to do so, but for family reasons, I need to permanently move back to Germany. I would be commuting to Dublin for work (I work in IT, so it would work out), but it would be only a total of 60 days per year and I wouldn't have a permanent residence in Ireland either, I would be staying in a hotel for the time in Dublin. The remaining 300+ days I would be living in Germany. So, I would be a German resident but I am paying full taxes in Ireland which means I am (and would continue to be) health insured in Ireland.

I was told in Germany that the cross border directive will allow me to access all of the health care in Germany - which will be my only home country - that people insured in the German public system receive.

But from reading the HSE pages I now got the impression that I will only receive the health care in Germany that people in the Irish public system receive. So, I wouldn't receive the same public health care as, say, my neighbour or my mother.

Also, from what I understood, should I develop a long-term illness I would not be entitled to receive cancer, MS, organ-transplant etc. treatment In Germany despite the fact that I am insured in the Irish public system through the taxes I'm paying and am a permanent resident in Germany and hence couldn't simply ""return"" to Ireland because there is nowhere to return to.

But all of the information on the HSE pages seems to be referring to Irish residents, which I wouldn't be anymore.

The company I work for is Irish, not German. I would pay for the commuting myself entirely.

Does anyone know more? Has anyone any actual experience with health-insurance and working and living in two different European countries?

Travel Exception from USA to Germany," 

Hi everyone.

On the [BMI website they say:](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/travel-restrictions-border-control/travel-restriction-border-control-list.html#f13919566)

&gt;**Short-term entry by first- and second-degree relatives who are third-country nationals only if urgent family reasons are demonstrated**

 

Exemptions are made only for urgent family reasons; the following cases and occasions are considered to constitute urgent family reasons:

births

weddings

deaths/funerals

special exceptional cases in which there is an urgent family reason (e.g. serious illness of a first- or second-degree relative who therefore urgently needs help)

Travelers are asked to carry with them suitable proof of an urgent family reason, which clearly demonstrates the need to cross the border.

Looking for movie,"Hi everyone, 

I am looking for the name of one German-language movie  that was made probably in early 2000s. I know for the fact that I watched this movie in summer 2003 or 2004.  Description below. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is supposed be a movie about troubled teenage boy growing. He is being raised by single mother and abused by her boyfriend. Mom is frequently not home. The boyfriend takes the money  mom gave to the teenager and he locks him out of his mom's apartment. The teenager is bullied at school.  I remember scene where they peed in his shoes  and when he fought the bully the Physical education teacher punished them both by forcing them to do pull-ups. The teenager has love-hate relationship with his neighbour. I remember scene where the teenager carkeyed the neighbour's car ( Volkswagen New Beetle Cabrio ) but then I also recall that they reconciled and because the neighbour bought the teenager the new shoes. The teenger lives in appartment block and he goes on the rooftop to try the shoes out just jumping and fooling around.  Toward the end of the movie his mother goes for ride with her boyfriend and dies in car crash and the teenager finds out by turning on the TV news. To the best ability of non-German speaker watching German movie I understood that the teenager was sent to orphanage but I think the neighbour ended up adopting him, if I am right. 

I am sorry I know my descirption is very vague but if anyone by any chance could find this movie I would be gratefull. I don't even know if this is German movie or Austrian movie or Swiss movie.

Bear in mind that I watched this movie as a kid with zero knowledge of German language  and I only understood the plot from what I saw and thus movie might have different meaning. Moreover, it was long time ago therefore I don't remember it that well.",Business-Elevator-84,germany

I also went to the Auslaenderbuero to have my biometric data taken. The Fiktionsbescheinigung is set to expire on Nov 6th, but I haven't heard back yet on anything.

I've put up a bigger fence between our properties in hopes that would stop them from randomly entering my property to either yell at me or snoop trough my stuff in the garden but that has only made it worse (the fence is up to standards and they have no legal grounds to do anything about it, trust me I've checked). But now it has come to the point where they follow me around and them physically hurting me doesn't seem that far fetched anymore. I live in Hamburg if that makes any diffrence for any rules regarding filming them. I've done some homework on CCTV cameras on my property and from what I've read it can't film anything but my own property and there needs to be a clear warning before getting in the camera's vision that you will be filmed. But I have no clue if I can grab my phone and film them on the streets when they are following me around. Some advice would be greatly appreciated!

"Moving to Germany soon, any city recommendations?","Hello

I am soon moving to Germany as my work contract requires it. However, at least in the short-term, I have the flexibility to choose a city to live in as I work from home. Do you guys have any recommendations amidst Covid times?

Some things about me:

* Young professional in robotics
* Never been to Germany before
* Know basic A1-level German from school
* Have a car
* Would like to live in an expat-friendly place and there's plenty of young people (the two usually go together)
* Want to be in a place where there's a tech scene (i.e., meetups, conferences, etc..)

I  have just got hired by UK company to develop new e-commerce platform in Germany (payment, delivery, sales all-in-one), but I have never been there and even now, working remotely from another country.   
My task is to find small and medium seller, like fashion, home ware, electronics, who want to have

Breast Reduction Surgery with Insurance,"Apologies if this makes some people uncomfortable, but I wanted to ask.

I've recently moved to Germany, I registered here this week, I'm a freelancer and for the last three years or so, I've been wanting to have a breast reduction.  I have completely disproportionate breasts to my body size, and I hate it. 

Since moving to Germany, this desire hasn't changed at all, but it struck me that I may potentially be able to have surgery covered by insurance here. Currently, I don't have insurance (I'm an EU citizen and only moved a month ago so am still getting everything together)

My question is - is this possible? I've seen on other forums that it is, in extreme circumstances with back pain, psychological distress etc  (AOK and TK have both accepted it for other women on these bases and I fulfil that criteria) but would I need to be a citizen here, or would I need to have been paying my health insurance for a certain amount of time?

Studying for the German theory driving license test,"Hello dear members of r/Germany

I turn to you, hoping you can provide me some guidance in regards to the preparation for the theoretical test so I can get my driving license here in Germany.

I want to study without a Farhschule and use them only to take the tests, and I have found a couple of apps, for example 123Fahrschule or ""Führerschein 2020 Theorie"", which have a lot of sample questions but actually no explanation or real theory. Of course this is helpful, still I would like to buy a book with explained material so that I can learn by myself and get all the information instead of just memorizing questions.

Your German Language Learning Hacks,"Hello, my beloved foreigner colleagues!

That is, I have some useful experience on learning languages.

Some of my background: I did A1 and A2 at the Göthe Institut but during B1 I felt that I needed to spend more time studying at home and that the course was not being so much useful due to the teacher we had back then.

So, the question is, how did you get disciplined and which tricks did you use to make your learning journey more efficient?

Looking for German World War 2 officer,"Hi Neighbors,

I'm an archaeologist in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Currently we're doing a massive dig at a World War 2 site. We've excavated many interesting finds and structures. Unfortunately as the excavation is ongoing I'm not allowed to share much information as of yet.

During the dig we've found a name tag with the inscription of a certain ""Matth. Fruhen"", which would probably mean either Matthias or Mattheus? So far we think it belonged to a clothing trunk, and only officers had such trunks with them. This specific shelter we excavated could have been the home of officer Matthias Fruhen in the year 1944.

"Moving in to Germany before the start date of my visa, using my valid residence in another EU country.

I have already got my visa which starts at the same time as my expected job start date. 

However, as I was not able to find an apartment with a contract that starts at the same time as my work contract, I had to rent the most suitable one I found with an additional month prior to my job start date. Since I paid for that month, I am thinking of simply moving in. This period will not be covered by the German visa but by my current residence permit which, AFAIK, allows me to stay in another Schengen country up to 90 days. Obviously, my current residence permit does not allow me to work in Germany, so I won't be using it to work there. I will just use that period to start paperwork, settle and explore the city.

Best city to live in for an outdoor lover with no car?,"Hello all!  


I'm hoping to make the move to Germany in the spring but it's hard to narrow down cities because there are so many great options.   


I love hiking, especially around the mountains (I tend to avoid going up anything technical). However, I don't drive, so I'll need to be somewhere that has ideally direct bus or train routes to awesome outdoor spots. Major bonus if I can hike between stations (long distance trails are more than fine).   


Other than that, no where too terribly small as I've been bouncing around countries for years and that whole loneliness thing is starting to set in, so I'm thinking it might be time to meet other humans. I love places with lots of old architecture, but that is definitely not a necessity. I work remotely, so the job market is of no concern.

Arbeitslosengeld For Non-EU Foreigner,"Hi there, I am married to a German and had settled down quite recently.

Racism/Xenophobia towards Asian/Chinese people,"Malaysian Chinese here looking into studying in Germany after COVID-19 . My question is the attitude of Germans towards Chinese/Asian people.

I am of Chinese descent (my great grandparents were Chinese but moved to Malaysia), but I am a Malaysian citizen. I have literally never, ever stepped foot in China (maybe if you count Hong Kong/Macau) and have no connection to the Chinese Government. In fact, I think I am actually very “westernised”.

Totally Confused about Corona Restrictions When Traveling between states within Germany,"Sorry in advance if this is answered elsewhere of I am clear where to find out on Corona rules traveling to different countries and where to find this information (Robert Koch Institute)  - this is totally clear to me - but quiet confused about whether it is ok to travel to different states within Germany as I have heard contradictory information about this. 

For example I have heard Neukölln or Mitte in Berlin are ""Risk areas"" but where should I be looking for regular news to see if my area is a risk area, local restrictions and how should I check if I am aloud to say, travel to Dresden for a few days? 

I think i found the website for Health in Mitte (?)

[https://www.berlin.de/ba-mitte/politik-und-verwaltung/aemter/gesundheitsamt/](https://www.berlin.de/ba-mitte/politik-und-verwaltung/aemter/gesundheitsamt/)

 but I can't see it mentioning  if Mitte is a ""risk area"" or information Travel restrictions, but then I found this article which seems to mention fines of 10,000 euros for travelling from a risk area 

[https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/thema/2020/coronavirus/beitraege\_neu/2020/10/berliner-bezirke-als-risikogebiet-eingestuft-ihre-rechte-herbstreisen.html](https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/thema/2020/coronavirus/beitraege_neu/2020/10/berliner-bezirke-als-risikogebiet-eingestuft-ihre-rechte-herbstreisen.html)

Or are ""Risk Areas""  not decided by the local health authority rather  decided on a state by state level, for instance Saxony could decide a specific area of Berlin is a ""Risk area"" but Bayern doesn't ? 

Given there is talk of 10,000 Euro fines it would be nice if someone would  be so kind as to point me to where I can find clear information about this? : )",Pleistoscenic-drive,germany

Looking for German learners for user interviews,"Hi guys! My name is Yehor and I am a German language teacher with a Goethe C2 certificate and a YouTube-blogger.

The reason I am writing this post is that I've come up with an idea to create an app that helps to organize language learners' workflow.

Since I’ve been teaching German for more than 6 years so far, I've got some solid understanding of the language acquisition process and I’ve got some ideas on how it could be implemented in the app.

I already have a small team who is ready to work on the product and we are currently in the last step of the exploration phase: we are conducting short interviews, where we ask people to share their experience concerning learning German.

We are doing it because It is crucial for us to validate our ideas and gather some useful insides from real learners with different backgrounds. We have already interviewed more than 50 Russian-speaking learners and now we are looking for the English-speaking ones.

So, if you are a German language learner and you could share your language learning story with us during a 20-minute Zoom or Skype call, just leave a message here and we will get in contact with you. What is your current level, whether you learn German online or offline, and whether you do it on your own or with a tutor isn't essential for us now, the only things that matter is that you are learning German or you have been learning it in the last year.

We will be really grateful for your help and we promise we won’t forget you when the product is ready 😄",DerR1chter,germany

Have to move from permanent employee to freelance," I am working as a full time employee for Company 'A' since 02 years. But I was hired and on pay rolled by Company 'B'. Both companies have some internal contract between them. Due to some issues Company A doesn’t want to continue with B. So 'A' has talked to a new company ‘C’ and wants me to get enrolled through that. I love working with A and due to Covid-19 its not that easy to find a better job, so I would definitely want to continue with them (also B doesn’t have any project right now, so B can’t pay me anymore). 'A' is a multinational company and the same changes has made all across the world.  


But the problem is ‘C’ doesn’t have any office in Germany and they want me to continue as freelancer till then. It might me one year or maybe more. I will get my PR in 04 weeks, so no issue with freelance visa.  Here comes all my questions:  
 

1. As my 100% income will come from one source, will it be considered as Scheinselbstständigkeit ? If so, is there any legal bindings? Or is it just a term?  
 

2. I will get my payments monthly.  How often do I have to pay/declare my taxes? Every month? Every quarter year?   
 

3. I must need one Steuerberater to pay/declare my taxes. How much does he/she charge on general? Where can I find one? Cause mine is very small matter (I believe), but Google takes me to the big firms.

Student Visa (or not?) and School,"So I just want to make sure I’ve got this right. A person from the United States can go to Germany for 90 days. This same person does not need to get a student visa or permit because they are from the United States.

Does this person just... stay? After the 90 days are up and they are enrolled in a school, does the person just stick around? And then after school, they apply for a permit to look for work?

Then suddenly I was told they would need to discuss the matter with a random technician before letting me know. Now that I got a date for the installation of the faster internet, they simply told me I was not allowed to do it and I should cancel the installation of my faster internet. 

  
Is it legal for my landlord to not allow me to get a better internet connection?

Question regarding Fiktionsbescheinigung: § 81 Abs. 4 AufenthG,""" § 81 Abs. 4 AufenthG sagt :

Beantragt ein Ausländer die Verlängerung seines Aufenthaltstitels oder die Erteilung eines anderen Aufenthaltstitels, gilt der bisherige Aufenthaltstitel vom Zeitpunkt seines Ablaufs bis zur Entscheidung der Ausländerbehörde als fortbestehend.

Gem. Abs. 5 erhält der Betroffenen eine Bescheinigung über diese so genannte Fiktionswirkung. Die Bescheinigung ist als schengenwirksamer Titel ""hinterlegt"". Mit dieser Bescheinigung, dem Pass und dem alten Titel kann er innerhalb der Schengenländer reisen, wie mit einer Aufenthaltserlaubnis oder einer Niederlassungserlaubnis.""

Now my question is, if you have already applied for a new Aufenhaltstitel before the current one expires, and if the Ausländerbehörde is not able to arrange a meeting before the Aufenhaltstitel expiration date, does the Ausländerbehörde sends you a Fiktionsbescheinigung?

Is it mandatory for them to send you a Fiktionsbescheinigung?

German Efficiency,"I had quite an interesting experience a few years ago and thought you guys might be interested. 

Me and some friends from our youth organization were in France because we had an international workshop to exchange our views on the flood of asylum seekers in Europe. There were people from France, Italy, Greece, Spain and some asylum seekers from Ghana and DRK. 

To get to know each other we had some sort of scavenger hunt (we Germans call it Schnitzeljagd xDD) 

Every team consisted of people from different countries one of each country in every group.

So we ran as fast as we could to reach the first check point and there was the Spanish coach who gave us our first task. He placed a bottle on the ground and drew a line with chalk. There was about a meter between the line and the bottle. He then told us we had to get the bottle without touching the ground behind the line. 

The idea behind this task was quite clear, we were to hold someone’s hand for example while they lean over to the bottle to show our team work. 

Well the Italian girl and Greek girls as well as the Spanish boy started talking about how we would do it right away, but while they did so my German brain was just calculating and thinking: “hmm...this doesn’t seem to be that long of a way actually...might as well just reach it...”. 

And while they were still tactically discussing I just kneeled down on one knee, stretched out my arm as far as I could without crossing the line with my front knee and just grabbed that bottle.

As soon as I stood up everyone was looking at me, including the coach with a look that said: “well...that should do it too...” and the Spanish boy just yelled: “F*cking Germans” and everyone was  laughing so hard 😂😂😂.

From that point onward “German efficiency” became a running gag for the entire week to come. 😂",STHF95,germany

Got hit by a car. My German colleagues are telling me to claim damages and bill the other's insurer...,"Hallo zusammen,

Long story short I was hit by a car when biking (driver is in the wrong). Ambulance was called, police took statements (I opted not to press charges when asked), etc. and we exchanged contact details. Luckily for me I didn't have to go to the hospital but still had to see several doctors (concussion, and hurt my back)... Anyway my bike was a rental, and insured so no problem there. The car was damaged a bit but the driver told me it was old and wouldn't cost much because she knew a guy. OK. Now my idea was to get this over with as soon as possible (filling paperwork with a concussion is not something I recommend for fun), involve as few parties as possible, you know, get this behind me. No broken bones, I consider myself lucky.

Now here's the thing - she just sent me a car repair bill for almost 3000€. A sizable portion of which is ""varnish, general body repair"" etc. I'm pretty sure she just told her repair guy to load up as much as possible since my insurer is supposed to pay.

So she hits me (wrongly), pays nothing, likely no fine, and gets 3k worth of touch-up done on her car? Meanwhile I'm typing this here with my back hurting like hell after visiting doctors, spending hours on Papierkram not to mention potential lasting effects of a concussion.

Of course, I'm happy to be alive and I realize my doctors bills will be paid for (or mostly) and that's the most important. But my colleagues are telling me to try to obtain damages for the trouble she put me through, and to claim at least something (I did rip some clothes in the accident). I'm beginning to think they are right, but I don't know much about the Germany system. 

What should I do, do you have any recommendations? Should I go to the police again? Anyone else has experience with claiming stuff from insurers (I've literally never been involved in an accident before)?

Thank you so much for the help! and sorry about the rambling. My back makes me grumpy...",GiffenCoin,germany
How to finance my second year in Germany,"So, to get to the point straight away: I have covered my projected living expenses for my first year of masters in Germany (and thus got the student visa) but I am still unsure of how I'd be able to cover the  expenses of the year after.

Inputs on Schiller International University in Heidelberg.,"Hi,

Hope you all are doing well.

I'm a prospective international student looking to pursue Masters.

I've been enquiring about studying abroad and I would like to graduate with a Master's in either Public Health or International Relations as both are quite close to my heart. 
I did come across Schiller International University in Heidelberg and I've been checking the website, speaking with the admissions department, trying to get more information about it.

What appealed to me was the teaching methodology.

However, my main concerns are that it's an American private University based in Heidelberg... and also with regards to the quality of education and the importance of the degree in the market vis a vis other German universities for the same course..


Kindly let me know whether is it alright to study in Schiller international University and how is it generally perceived. Any input would be great. 

Take care and Warm Regards.",WhatDoUWan2B,germany
When can the WG owner kick me out?,"I am debating whether I should live alone or in a WG with an old lady. She seems nice and we seem compatible, but there is always a but so I fear we might not be compatible or that she would be able to kick me out at any point.

I know that standard lease (Mietvertrag) states the landlord can kick you out in three cases:

1. If they need the place for themselves of family members.

2. If the lease runs for a fixed term.

3. Special occasion which I didn't really understand. My friend explained it like if a secret service need the apartment for undercover work or something.

Is it the same for WG lease (Untermietvertrag) if the lease is indefinite?

If no, how could it differ? Can the WG owner decide the terms?

It’s not too much stuff. A bed, desk, desk chair, tv,  a few smaller shelves &amp; 2 big suitcases of clothes. A truck definitely isn’t needed but a transit van or something like that would likely be big enough.

German Visa + Changing Employers - Appointment wait time 3 months.,"Looking for advice if anyone has gone through changing their employer recently.

Coming from Canada, I have been working in Hamburg since March 2019.
I was offered a new job by a company I've always wanted to work for, closer to Frankfurt, and starting on February 1, 2021. Almost two years since starting my current job.

Now I have to apply to change my Zusatzblatt (visa not the blue card), so I sent an email to my local Ausländerbehörde in Hamburg and they booked my appointment for the earliest date of January 21, 2021 -- which is over three months away. (because of COVID?)

The issue is that I need to give three months' notice to my current employer and have to move near Frankfurt. It would be very difficult to do that and then get rejected by the Ausländerbehörde. Then I would be without a job, living near Frankfurt, and probably have to sell everything and move my family back to Canada.

Grade Conversion Confusion," 

I got officially accepted around 6 months ago for a masters degree in Germany and am already in the process of paying and enrolling. For some reason, though, I have a worry: The uni had put 2.5 as a grade requirement and I am still not certain how my grade converts to their scale (Bavarian, modified Bavarian,...) or whether or not the grade is strictly a requirement or more of a weighting factor.

I contacted the program coordinator for peace of mind and she told me that she's not the one who ultimately takes the decision but she did a tertiary and quick check and told me my grade is a 2.5 or better. I am still confused because some conversions I've used (using my uni's conversion table) put me at a GPA of 2.7 or the equivalent of a B or B-, which according to another table is a 2.5 in the German grading system.

Am I overthinking this? I rechecked my uploaded documents and I had provided all my transcript grades that show my final grade as well as all relevant documents.

"Living in Germany: Munich vs Rhine-Ruhr area (Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Essen ...)","I'm a software developer looking to move to Germany with my family (wife, child and baby).  
We're in our late 30s.  
My wife has a university degree in law, and she has passed the bar exam in our country, but I'm not sure how will that transfer to Germany. If not, she'll go through some re-education and training, maybe for a completely different proffesion.  
I started learning German language and my wife doesn't speak German. The plan for her is to learn it in Germany. For what I've seen some companies don't require German, just English.  

After thinking about where, we've come to two options: **Munich** or **Rhine-Ruhr area (Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Essen ...)**.   

 
The criteria in our consideration are:

- City size
More job opportunities and more stuff to do in bigger cities (we're looking for population of 500k+)

- Stuff to see and do in the city
We're not people who like to sit in front of the TV every evening after work, so we would like to have options for stuff to do and see in both weekdays and weekends.
This includes: sightseeing, cultural events, museums, walks, maybe sport events, fun things for kids. Night life or clubbing is not that important, as we've done our fair share of it when we were younger.

- Stuff to see and do outside the city
We like walks in nature, near water, wandering around, swimming ... (I prefer natural lakes instead man-made as they had more time to develop nice beaches and shores)

- Connectivity
We like to travel, a lot. We're looking for a city which is well connected for making car and plane weekend trips. Preferably one with an airport with low-budget airlines (RyanAir, WizzAir ...)

- Living costs and salary
I would be the primary source of income, at least for the first year or two, because my wife will be taking care of the baby and the child. So we need to be able to live with one software developer salary.

- Real estate availability and prices
As we're looking to settle in Germany, we would like to have a chance and options for bying a house.

- Commute
Good city for driving or public transport. We all want to spend less time to and from work.

- Climate
We're looking for a city with less rain

I haven't been to any of the cities in consideration, nor do I have anyone close living there to ask for experience, so all my thoughts are based around research.


My thoughts about **Munich**:
*Pros*: Big city, listed in almost all ""top cities"" lists. Lot of stuff to do and see, lots of history. It has great nature around it (big lakes, the Alps).
*Cons*: Maybe the most expensive city in Germany, weekend trips by car are limited to German culture (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), nearest airport with low-budget airlines is at 110km in Memmingen.


My thoughts about the **Rhine-Ruhr area**:
*Pros*: Probably cheaper than Munich, well connected to different cultures for weekend trips by car (Belgium, Netherlands, France), the biggest cities have nearby airports, many big cities in small area, 150km of urban area (not sure if pro or con)
*Cons*: Not as beautiful as Munich, less nature (Sauerland with small man-made lakes)

Is there any possible way to find my grandparents?,"Hi there! I'll (try to) keep this rather short as I realise this might not be the place to post this. 

Long story short my dad was born in Cologne and was adopted by a US family. There is a story that his birth parents were from two very different classes and their parents (would be my dad's grandparents) on one side (the wealthy side) didn't approve of the pregnancy. 

That could all be a load of drivel of course. I'm not sure how in the world a baby from Germany would get adopted by a US family in the 60's but I'm not top up to date on my international adoption history laws. 

I'm 30 years old. Both my parents passed away when I was 5. 

I have my dad's naturalization certificate where on the back it says his was changed from his birth name. The odd thing is that his birth name doesn't appear to be a German name (or name at all) according to Google. 

I know Germany has very good data privacy laws so I'm not expecting too much but I thought no harm in making this post and asking for any guidance or direction. 

Just something I always wondered! I moved back to Scotland (from the US) to meet a lot of my mom's side of the family which has been amazing but I imagine there's little hope for me somehow tracking down my dad's side. 

Hope everyone has a great night and if you read this far, thanks a lot! My family history  is complicated it would help if I could draw a picture haha.",Adiroit,germany

Studying photography; good idea?,"Hello Reddit!

So recently (1 year ago) I started studying computer science not out of passion or out of fun but because it offers a good future with a lot of good workplaces with good pay. 
The problem is I would really rather study photography. I love the creative process of finding an interesting place and then freezing that moment forever and the retouching it to make it even better but as far as I know it the job market is complete garbage and the pay is really low. 
My question goes to people who studied photography or are currently working as a photographer. Do you recommend to study photography?

Where to buy a laptop,"Moin! Okay so I'm buying a new laptop and I would like some advice. I bought the last one in Mediamarkt, but I'm looking for more websites or places to buy it.

what's the hardest part of life in germany?,"as an american who's spent a cumulative 2 years in germany now, i am just in awe of the country. many things i've heard from the germans i've met are different (and better) than the USA:

\- no crippling debt for college

\- no crippling debt for medical issues/better healthcare system

\- more job security and benefits (up to 6 weeks off? it's difficult to get fired?? more stable retirement system?)

\- great public transportation

\- more competent government

\- less violence, especially gun related

so far the few cons i've seen are lower salaries compared to US and that people are a little less friendly and more cold. despite that i would really like to move here one day, and would love if my children could grow up here.

this has all left me wondering, in your opinion/experience, what are the most difficult parts of life in germany? what do you think the country's social systems, quality of life, etc. are lacking?",studiofrog,germany
Proof of sufficient funds for students from EU countries,"So, I've just moved to Germany for my Master studies, I finished all the formalities like city registration, opening bank account, health insurance, etc. 

However, in the next 4 weeks, I have to send proof to the Ausländerbehörde that I have sufficient funds for my expenses so I can acquire the right of free movement.

My question is, which amount is considered as sufficient? I couldn't find that information on the internet,  I even contacted the office, and received a short answer: ""Please send me a bank statement"".  My current bank statement shows sufficient funds for the next 2-3 months, but I already found a part-time job and I will receive support from my parents. I am afraid that this sum won't be enough, but if I knew what's considered as a minimum of sufficient funds, my parents will manage to transfer them on my account.

I asked the guidance in my current school and they said that the diplomas are only given after you finish grade 11 &amp; 12.

It wouldn't be a big deal however there is water inside it which we can not remove because of its location. We now have small flies coming and it stinks really bad. Not to mention we have a small child here. He is ignoring our messages and our calls and I would say its rather an unsanitary domicile for us at the moment.

Question about Studienkolleg,"I would like to join the Studienkolleg and start a Bachelor degree in Germany. In order to be eligible attend university in Germany for any subject I would have to finish university in my home country. Right now I’m in my last year in University which gives me a “fachgebundene Hochschulreife”. So I could already go to university but only for subjects similar to the one I study already. My question is if I’m allowed to apply for the Studienkolleg. Because at the time the deadline for bachelor degrees end I won’t have my degree yet and therefore no allgemeine Hochschulreife. But on many websites it stated that you can only join the Studienkolleg if you have to. So I’m unsure about it. On the one hand I would theoretically not need the Studienkolleg because I will be finished with my bachelors at the time the next bachelor degree in Germany starts, on the other hand I won’t be able to submit my Hochschulzugangsberechtigung in time and all university websites say that submitting it after the deadline is impossible for bachelor degrees.

Am I eligible for German citizenship?,"So I was born in München back in 2002 and lived there to 2006. It was truly an amazing time and I have a lot of fond memories from that time. My parents currently hold a Swedish and Bosnian citizenship and so do I. I am therefore wondering if I am eligible for a German citizenship because I was born there and lived there for 4 years and if so would I have to revoke any of my existing citizenships.

Many thanks in advance!!!",km250,germany

(M/25/Indian) I can't help but wonder what my expat experience would be like if I was White instead of Brown.,"Before I get downvoted or misunderstood, I want to clarify this post is **not** to accuse anyone, let alone all Germans, of being racist or intolerant. I have met some really friendly and welcoming people but I have also met some unfriendly ones. It was my decision to come here and I did not expect everything to be perfect. So I am not here to complain. I just felt like sharing some thoughts I have been having recently after becoming friends with a few white expats here. I was stunned to discover how different our expat experiences in Germany have been. I don't like extreme identity politics and I don't concur to the idea that white people have it easy in their lives and don't struggle with problems because of their ""white privilege"". We all have our problems. But in certain cases like this one, being white certainly makes your experience more pleasant.

Barring one or two incidences, I have not faced blatant racism. But the little things to add up over time which make me wonder about hypothetical scenarios like this. When I'm walking down the street with a group of Indians, people usually avoid walking close to us. This doesn't happen when I'm with my White friends. I've noticed this on trains and busses as well. People avoid sitting next to me when I'm with my Indian friends. This doesn't happen when I'm with my White friends. Another thing I've observed is that when a White friend of mine struggles with German, the locals are more adjusting. When I struggle, I am immediately met with a face of disapointment. Of course all these things don't happen when I'm at university because the younger generation is more open and culturally aware. 

When I arrived in Germany, I did not have permanent accommodation so I stayed with a friend and over the next two weeks, I made multiple visits to the Studierendenwerk in my city to get a dorm. During my last visit, I took a Polish friend with me since she had applied for a dorm as well. We went to the office together and finally, they had some vacancies as other people had moved out. Not to my surprise, she got a nice dorm close to the city center whereas I was allotted a dorm in a not-so-safe suburb and a huge migrant population. I know close to 50 Indian students in my city and almost live in the same dorm. The buildings have the capacity to accommodate close to 500 people and 90% of the population here is African, South-east Asians, Indian (including Pakistanis and Bangladeshis), and Chinese. I swear I have seen only 3 white people living in the dorm in my two years here. On the other hand, almost all my white friends live in the newer dorms in better districts. Maybe this is because of the way our food smells, maybe we are more noisy or maybe our cultures are too different. It is possible that the dorm authorities don't want complains from locals in the dorm's neighbourhood. I am not sure about the reasons. But I am sure that this strategy is extremely destructive to the social fabric on the long run. If the German government has made the decision to take foreign students, they also need to prepare for the social changes which might happen outside of the university campus. Putting all the foreigners in one area would prevent integration and reinforce stereotypes. 

I sort of understand where this comes from. Hollywood and international media's portrayal of India is out-of-date. We are more developed, educated (not just formally) and culturally aware than most Westerners think. I'm sure it is the case with many other developing countries. Politically, I am a liberal but I do understand why stereotypes are unavoidable. Our brains are excellent at detecting and remembering patterns. As we grow up and experience the world around us, our brains start associating certain traits with certain groups (ethnic, religious, etc) over time as we accumulate experience. For eg., you would be more scared walking towards a group of men at night compared to a group of women because there's a higher probability of you being mugged by men.

This rant wouldn't change anything. Stereotypes are unavoidable sometimes because they are true to an extent. We don't live in a perfect world and I don't know the solutions to these problems but I often wonder how our wordview and experiences are different JUST because of our skin colour and ethnicity. I don't plan to stay here after I graduate but I am grateful to the people who went out of their way to help me and make my experience pleasant. :)",AdOk1219,germany

Specific Corona testing question concerning travel and testing time.,"So I'm from Köln but am currently working in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. My wife and girlfriend are going to visit me on Friday. They have to have a CV test showing negative within 48 hours of when they leave. The time the test takes is often 48 hours to get it back. If they take the test on Tuesday it would come back Thursday and they would have the test results for 24 hours when they leave on Friday... But they TOOK the test on Tuesday, 72 hours before. But if they were to get the test on Wednesday they may not get the results in time to leave...

What do the kinder and young adults do for fun/entertainment?,"A little explanation to why I'm asking.  I've wanted to learn a 2nd language for a long time.  I can't settle on a language and hop around.  Spanish would be very practical for me to learn, but I don't really like it.  Comparing me learning the basics of various languages, German is the easiest language I have come across but speaking it decently is very hard for me, I would stress out my throat trying to get it to sound correct.

So I am wondering what young people do for fun, in Germany, to help me figure out if I really want to spend time learning it.  In America, people love sports, drinking, video games, cars, movies/tv.  I've never really liked sports at all and don't really drink, much less go out and drink, and I'm too poor to get into cars other than commuting.  So I do video games, movies, and TV.  I have not been able to find much about Germans on this.  I have Netflix and they have movies and TV in different languages, but the German section is very small.  Do Germans like to play Call Of Duty or other video games?

Before I ask way to many questions, someone could chime in.",bigblackglock17,germany

Interest in Transferring to German Uni. for Philosophy (and Language Immersion),"I'm an undergraduate currently studying philosophy in the U.S. As of now, I have zero experience with the German language, but lately I have have been increasingly interested in studying German (in order to read primary texts without having to rely on translations). 

On that note, I have been considering filling out international transfer applications since (a) I've heard there is, at least in some cases, a substantial international community in German universities and (b) I would much prefer an immersive approach for learning a second language.

From the research I've done thus far, I've found the University of Heidelberg and the University of Tübingen appealing based on their international populations and strength in the humanities, however, I'm fairly sure I've hardly scratched the surface.

I'd appreciate any suggestions and/or advice regarding schools to consider, expectations/potential issues with my lack of German, and general info regarding the German University system.

My academic interests revolve around philosophy, psychoanalysis, psychology, history, art, etc. – particularly, philosophy and psychoanalysis.",ProfoundJackass,germany
