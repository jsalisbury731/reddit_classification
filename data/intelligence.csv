I’m trying to decide which pathway to take and I’m in the process of drawing out pros/cons before making a commitment to either. They obviously have their costs (Army requires at least a year in another MOS before applying to 35F/L so with training approx 6 years total service, and grad schools range between 32-67k for 3-4 years).

How to verify username on the Internet with high efficiency,"*Note: post - machine translation, English is not the mother tongue of the author.*

&amp;#x200B;

To increase search efficiency, for example, by compiling Yandex and Google dorks (“username” site: [https://site.com/\*](https://sites.ru/*)) Or, for example, using specialized software. In the article we’ll talk about one such software.

&amp;#x200B;

[Snoop Project!](https://github.com/snooppr/snoop)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/apa6cuq0gkz41.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81663aa8483cf3500462df7ffc50b609484b400e

Snoop is an OSINT forensic tool that searches for nicknames in public data.

Snoop is a fork of Sherlock software (which was inspired by the idea of a barely living [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName) project), with improvements and changes:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/75ifuni4gkz41.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e44fa64e0ccff80ea49b3dda09a519f9cc8087f

*\* The Snoop database is several times larger than the combined Sherlock + Spiderfoot + Namechk + WhatsMyName bases combined.*

*\* Snoop has fewer false positives than Sherlock that all similar tools have (example of Websites comparison: Ebay; Telegram), changes in the operation algorithm (snoop can detect username.salt).*

*\* New options.*

*\* Support sorting and HTML format*

*\* Improved informative output.*

*\* Ability to update software.*

*\* Informative reports (uploaded ‘csv’ format, saving reports and navigating through them (HTML)).*

*\* In version 1.1.9, the Snoop database exceeded the mark of* ***1k sites!*** *Specially for Snoop, a couple of cyberpunk soundtracks were recorded.*

*\* In version 1.2.0, the ability to upload data has been added.*

*The history of the project is* [*here*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snooppr/snoop/master/changelog.txt)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/covhxg26gkz41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5c53952ddb7eb7d5365b0343d70ffbf8ebfee35

Snoop is declared as one of the most promising OSINT tools for finding username in open data and is accessible to the average user without taking into account the opinions of the NSA and their friends.

The tool is also oriented towards the RU segment, which is its huge advantage compared to similar OSINT applications.

Initially, a huge update of the Sherlock Project in the CIS was planned (but after \~ 1/3 of the entire database update), but at some point, Sherlock developers changed their course and stopped accepting updates, explaining this state of affairs by the “Restructuring” of the project and approaching the maximum possible number of resources in your websites database; So Snoop appeared, which went far ahead, without adapting to any external interests.

The project supports OS GNU / Linux, Windows, Android.

Do not forget to do updates, the project is developing rapidly.

Benefits for multinational corporations to buy government tax-exempt bonds,"Tax-empts bonds, generally known as municipal bonds, providing many benefits to cities, states, and countries provide municipal bonds to investors to increase money for infrastructure needs, daily operations and other projects. Although municipal bonds provide many advantages, they also provide some risks and disadvantages. As an investor, you should understand the advantages and limitations of investing in municipal bonds to plan if they fit within your future or present financial condition.

Keep more of your earnings

The main benefit of investing in municipal bonds is the capability to keep more of your returns because of tax exemption. When you purchase a bond that is not exempt, you must pay taxes on your interest income. So, even though, you may earn an eight percent of return of your corporate bond, in actuality you earn less than that because of taxes. A municipal bond permits you to reject paying taxes on your interest income. In some cases, although the rate of return of a municipal bond is lower than the rate of return of a business bond, you can still earn more money interest investing in the municipal bond because of the cash you saved via the tax exemption.

Low price volatility

Tax-exempts bonds experience low price volatility, which makes them a remarkable investment for the objective of diversification. Although not fully risk free, municipal bonds are quite low-risk assets. Much of the low risk and price volatility of the bonds is derived from the municipalities’ credit ratings. The low danger and price volatility specs are mainly attractive to senior investors looking for safe investment to save their retirement income. Anyway, investors should research municipal bonds before making investment plans.

Interest rate and returns

Compared to other bond types, municipal bonds provide quite low returns. The low returns of municipal bonds come from the fact that they are quite short-term, low-risk investments. Municipal bonds are also subject to interest rate danger, meaning that as interest rates rise, the market price of municipal bonds down. The longer the term of your municipal, the more uncovered you are to interest rate danger. Like other bonds, a municipality may call back a municipal bond if interest rate constantly drops.  In the mind of the municipality, it favors to call the bond and reissue it at a lower rate to reject paying you a higher rate of return. https://article-directory.org/article/801/9/Benefits-for-multinational-corporations-to-buy-government-tax-exempt-bonds",Giuelith,Intelligence

MWI Podcast: What’s Going on in North Korea?,"[https://mwi.usma.edu/mwi-podcast-whats-going-north-korea/](https://mwi.usma.edu/mwi-podcast-whats-going-north-korea/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Is Kim Jong-Un alive or dead? We don’t actually know—and that’s  remarkable. It’s also remarkable how little media attention the  situation in North Korea is receiving—crowded out, perhaps inevitably,  by the intense news coverage of the global COVID-19 pandemic. And yet  the country is in the midst of a situation that could have serious  ramifications for the region and for international security.

This episode features a conversation about just what is happening in  North Korea right now, and we’re joined by Dr. Van Jackson. He teaches  international relations at Victoria University of Wellington in New  Zealand, he is the author of a recent book called *On the Brink*, about the US-North Korea relationship, and he is also the host of the *Un-Diplomatic Podcast­*.  He offers some thoughts about what to make of the current situation in  North Korea, and also discusses how prepared—or unprepared—the United  States is for a potentially destabilizing event like the death of Kim  Jong-Un.

Listen to the full conversation with Dr. Jackson below, and be sure to subscribe to the *MWI Podcast* on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/modern-war-institute/id1079958510), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-modern-war-institute-at-west-point/the-modern-war-institute-podcast), or your favorite podcast app.",JohnWickin2020,Intelligence

How can I get personal information about a Tiktok/Insta/kik/skype/snap user?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I need your help. Someone sends death threats to a person and I would like to report this case to the police. I investigated a little bit, this is what I found: His username. He has Instagram, Tiktok, Skype and Kik. His old twitter, Insta and Tiktok have been banned because of the threats. He also have Snapchat and Roblox. He is inactive on social media, he doesn't communicate with anyone. I found his name, town and country on Skype, but when I googled that name, I only found a Polish game. According to Skype, he is from Poland, so this matches. But I found a profile pic about him on Kik, and he looks Indian, not Polish. I found these people by a username, so the results are not 100%, but this usename is quite unique. He doesn't have facebook and his Polish name is really weird too. It doesn't sound Polish at all. (nor Indian) Which OSINT tools should I use? Can someone help me to find this person? Then I can report him to the police. Please someone help me, I am stuck. Thank you.

"Entry level intelligence jobs, soon to be college grad","Hello! I’m a soon to be college grad (yikes) and I’m interested in the intelligence/security field. I will be graduating with a major in political science and minor in international affairs. Unfortunately I don’t speak a language, I do hope to restart learning Spanish. 

I’m at a loss of where to start looking, I understand the military can/is one of the best and maybe easiest paths to getting into intelligence. It’s not my first choice for various reasons. The civilian market is highly competitive and without any military experience I’m pretty low. Looking at job sites I do see entry level positions from BAE, Lockheed, etc that state a degree and no previous experience. Seems to good to be true. Are those truly entry level jobs? Would certificates help boost my resume meaningfully? I have been told by former people in the field that some places actually prefer to mold new people to their customs and ways so no experience isn’t always their biggest concern (not sure how accurate it is). The security clearance is another obstacle. I’ve been told that while jobs say you need to hold it, in many cases they will help you get it. Again, I’m doubtful of this unless you have some skill they desperately want. I don’t want to limit myself to much, but I think before I start just randomly applying and keeping my fingers crossed I need a better understanding of what even an entry level job wants right out of the gate.

 In this episode of Horns of a Dilemma, we listen to a discussion  moderated by Steve Slick of the Strauss Center and the Intelligence  Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin about the role of  intelligence in the COVID-19 pandemic. Slick is joined by Bobby Chesney,  director of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law, Paul  Pope, senior fellow at the Intelligence Studies Project, and Calder  Walton, assistant director of the Applied History Program at Harvard’s  Kennedy School of Government. Their conversation touches on whether the  failure to properly anticipate and warn about the novel coronavirus  constitutes an intelligence failure, what changes might be required in  the intelligence community in the wake of the pandemic, and what type of  investigation or inquiry might be appropriate in order to learn lessons  and incorporate changes for both the intelligence community and the  whole of government moving forward.",JohnWickin2020,Intelligence

The US relationship with Mexico is a fundamentally unique one. Mexico  is a close neighbor and key partner, and yet there are also challenges  associated with the relationship. Both the diplomatic and military  components of the relationship must be managed carefully and in  parallel, but also in a unified way within a comprehensive framework.

MWI’s distinguished chair, retired Gen. Charles Jacoby, served from  2011 to 2014 as the commander of US Northern Command, responsible for  the military relationship with the United States’ southern neighbor. His  counterpart, tasked with maintaining the diplomatic relationship, was  Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne, who served as ambassador to Mexico from  2011 to 2015. Together, they joined [Ambassador Deborah McCarthy](https://twitter.com/AMB_DMcCarthy), host of *The General and the Ambassador Podcast*, for a two-part series to share their unique experiences and perspectives.

In 2011, the year both Gen. Jacoby and Ambassador Wayne assumed their  roles, Mexico was in the midst of a major challenge to contain the  violence emanating from the drug trade and the cartels that controlled  it. In the first part of their conversation, they discuss that  challenge, as well as their efforts to build a necessary degree of trust  with their Mexican counterparts, and the importance of unity of effort  between US military and diplomatic officials.",JohnWickin2020,Intelligence

"We must remember the excesses and mistakes of the IC, lest we repeat them.","So this post was originally a comment responding to a thread inquiring about morals and ethics in the Intelligence Community.  I was surprised and ashamed that it seemed answers even vaguely critical of the IC got downvoted pretty hard, and i think it's important that we remember the IC has done some vile and pernicious things in pursuit of higher ideals, and we must remember the mistakes they made.  In fact, it was because of revelations of widespread abuse of power and overreach that we even have the pitiful, anemic methods of external oversight we enjoy today: the Senate and House Intel committees. I thought it important enough to dedicate a post going over just a few of those excesses, lest we forget what our intelligence apparatus is capable of,

I don't know why so many folks with honest answers were getting downvoted...  I guess spooks, exspooks, apparatchiks, and fanboys don't like to hear the truth, even in mildly dressed-down fashion.  I have known some people in the IC who I truly believe are honorable folks, and DO have morals and ethics.  That said,  experience and history have shown us the IC will absolutely bend whatever rules and limitations are placed on it to the absolute limit, and indeed flagrantly flout such restrictions when plausible deniability allows.  This is one of the inherent benefits of  and primary motivations for plausible deniability: the ability to get away with doing things one could NEVER do officially, as you can plausibly deny ever having done it.  But from the FBI's [COINTELPRO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO),  to the CIA's [CHAOS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS) and [MKULTRA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)--we KNOW the IC isnt bound by law OR morals/ethics. These are things they were *caught* doing and were *forced* to *partially* admit, not conspiracy theories.  We have the agencies' own documents, showing the FBI trying to blackmail MLK into killing himself,  and the CIA illegally spying on and disupting the antiwar left, not to mention using unwitting American citizens as human guinea pigs in fucking *mind control* experiments, dosing them with LSD without their knowledge or consent, creating entire front organizations like the [Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology](https://powerbase.info/index.php/Society_for_the_Investigation_of_Human_Ecology) to fund research projects and setting up literal brothels with one way mirrors and recording equipment to test drugs on 'johns'...see operation [Midnight Climax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax), a subproject of MKULTRA headed by former bureau of narcotics agent George Hunter White, himself an almost supervillain type of character. If you have any doubts, please,  educate yourselves by reading ""Poisoner in Chief"" by respected journalist Stephen Kinzer, a biography of Sidney Gottlieb, the man behind the MKULTRA experiments and head of the Technical Services Division of the CIA (oft called TSD or TSS).

This is not to say that the Agency hasn't done a lot of honorable, good work and saved many lives.   They undoubtedly have.  And indeed, just as I would argue the inexcusable, unspeakable excesses of the EIT program were done in the name of a higher good, allegedly fighting terrorism, so too were the indefensible atrocities perpetrated by the MKULTRA project done in the name of 'national security'.  But they are not constrained by any sense of ethics or morality in pursuit of what those in charge consider to be the greater good.  We must remember and shine bright lights on these greatly disturbing truths, as damaging to the IC's morale as it might be to do so, lest we ever allow such horrors to occur again.  Let us remember, the Nazis used  many of the same excuses and logic for their atrocities--and we [hired a great many of their most despicable doctors and scientists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip), including chemical/ biological warfare experts-- a number of whom went on to to work on ARTICHOKE/MKULTRA/BLUEBIRD, like [Kurt Blome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Blome) as painstakingly documented in Poisoner in Chief.",SweetDaddyJones,Intelligence

"Valerie Plame was an undercover CIA NOC, and her identity leak shows how self-centered politicians undermine the Intelligence Community, and place Americans in harm's way.","My stomach churns every time I see Karl Rove appear on TV news, for it brings back the subversive nature of the Valerie Plame (Wilson) leak and the backbreaking efforts our intelligence services employed to place her, a Non-Official-Cover (NOC) agent, abroad. 
     I think about the dangers she faced traveling to unfriendly countries undercover in order to shield Americans from weapons of mass destruction. Unlike Hollywood depictions, most overseas CIA operatives use State Department official cover -OC- and play the James Bond role, commonly seen wearing tuxedos at gambling tables and mingling with foreigners in embassy cocktail and dinner parties. 
     NOC's do not enjoy the protection of diplomatic immunity. If caught by foreign intelligence, they have no protection from prosecution under that country's laws. Before Karl Rove and Dick Cheney outed her, Valerie Plame didn't pretend to be a ""fake"" diplomat. She  assumed deep cover and distanced herself from the luxurious State Department life that is complete with rich foods and top-flight martinis.  
Using her cover, a vast mosaic of lies and props, she penetrated foreign organizations to detect and prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and fissile material that could be used to make dirty bombs and be detonated inside America. Neither personal friends, family members nor her fiancé knew she worked for the CIA's enigmatic Non-Proliferation Center in Langley, Va., a cadre of analysts, technical experts and former field operatives.
     In case a suspicious foreign intelligence service conducted a background check, she masqueraded as an ""analyst"" for a fake legal services company called Brewster-Jennings and Associates. This CIA front company was listed on her Federal Election Commission forms when she made political contribution, and to add credibility to the deception, the business was registered on the Dun and Bradstreet database and her 1999 W-2 tax forms listed B\~J and Associates as her employer. The workplace appeared above board, housed in a plush, 21-story office building in downtown Boston, complete with trendy restaurants. The setting allowed her to blend in with everyday life or, if the need arose, to exit quickly into the swarms of commuters who passed by as they exited the Downtown Crossing subway station. Business cards, a phone number and post office box number complemented the subterfuge. 
     Gambling on her NOC deep cover for protection, Plame ventured overseas, aiming to infiltrate groups involved in smuggling nuclear weapons and the material used to create them. She attended trade shows and business conferences abroad where she interviewed and attempted to recruit foreign scientists, and developed informal networks with engineers, secretaries, salespersons and suppliers. Plame used her NOC cover to ""by coincidence"" bump into honest and sleazy characters alike, whom her CIA handlers targeted. She hoodwinked, sweet-talked, bribed and recruited ""assets"" (spies) in order to gain information about raw materials and hardware even remotely associated with the process of building weapons-grade nuclear material that could someday wreak devastation on America's shores. 
     A while ago, I talked with Harry Mason, who retired from the CIA in 1997. he is an expert in foreign and domestic intelligence, earning both the prestigious CIA Intelligence medal of Merit and National Intelligence Medal of Achievement awards. Mason believes that, although the leak of Plame's name may not rise to a technical violation of the 1982 Intelligence Identities Act, CIA operatives must know they will be protected from traitors or political leakers...even if a key presidential aide has to resign. It's mind-boggling that the leak to columnist Robert Novak came from senior White House officials who signed form SF-312, an affirmative obligation not to reveal classified information. 
     Thousands of hours of undercover work and Plame's network of connections were shattered. Mason also hinted that foreign intelligence services would pour through passport databases to determine if Plame ever set foot on their soil. They, indeed, did just that and found out when she entered and located those she had contact with. Because of the Karl Rove leak, the lives of many foreign citizens were placed in jeopardy. I get upset when viewing Karl Rove, the Washington leader who donned pin-striped suits and wrapped himself around the flag...while exposing CIA covert operations. Mason believes stronger criminal prosecution laws are needed for the news media and for columnists like the late Robert Novak, who disclose covert identities that harm America's national security and put the lives of intelligence agents at risk. I agree wholeheartedly and remember hoping that all CIA NOC's who assumed Plame's Brewster-Jennings Associates cover and who had no diplomatic immunity...we’re exfiltrated back home quickly, alive and well.",spymaster2,Intelligence

China has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its  country, under-reporting both total cases and deaths it’s suffered from  the disease, the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a classified  report to the White House, according to three U.S. officials.

The  officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and  they declined to detail its contents. But the thrust, they said, is that  China’s public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally  incomplete.

Putin has ramped up espionage activities against America's allies and NATO. What should we do about it?," We were all worried about Putin’s cyber-attacks against the DNC and now fret over Russian interference in the 20202 elections, but we must not forget about other Russian espionage activities that target NATO and America's closest allies. U.S. Intelligence realizes that the Russian spy agency, SVR, has permeated NATO delegations that frequent its headquarters in Brussels. That’s why the size of non-member state delegations at the HQ have been severely limited- to cut down on Russian intelligence officers’ operating inside. Russia had three times as many delegates as any other non-NATO nation operating inside NATO’s Brussels headquarters, and most are there to gather intelligence (Should I say “steal” intelligence?).

President Trump may want to build a relationship with Putin, but he must realize that the Russian leader is conducting an all-out espionage assault on U.S. allies in Europe. Putin’s FSB has been watched closely by Estonia’s Internal Security Service (ISS).  The ISS found daring attempts to undermine Estonia’s sovereignty by the FSB, such as the 2014 kidnapping of Estonian Internal Security Service officer Eston Kohver. The FSB abducted Kohver from *inside* Estonia, convicted him in a show trial, only to exchange him for an FSB spy arrested in 2012! Lithuania’s intelligence agency warned in its 2015 annual report that Russia infiltrated not only its armed forces, but those of other NATO members as well. 

 Putin's spy agency reach is far and his spies have recently been caught in Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and Poland. Non-NATO allies of the U.S. have also been targeted. Russian agents spy on Swedish military facilities and approach Swedish military personnel on a regular basis. Sweden’s security service (Saepo) estimates that one-third of Russia’s diplomats in Stockholm are spies.

 Not surprising, the U.S. recently busted a Russian spy ring in New York City. They recruited U.S. citizens as spies and stole economic intelligence. In 2010, Russia’s espionage activities briefly came to the forefront of the American public’s attention when the FBI broke up a 10-person Russian spy ring. The FBI described these Putin-agents as Russia’s ""cream of the crop.""

 Overseas, American diplomats and NATO officials are continually harassed by Russian agents. An FSB guard assaulted an American diplomat outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow. A NATO officer at a Swedish restaurant was threatened by Russian agents who showed him pictures of his family while demanding information on alliance military exercises.

 Has the Cold War raised its ugly head once more? Should President Trump put more resources into the U.S. Intelligence Community’s efforts to combat Russian espionage and counterespionage operations? 

I believe so. Putin, the intimidator, has bolstered his intelligence assets against U.S. allies and NATO. President Trump must counter him and, as one American intelligence official put it, “play catch-up big time” with Russia.",spymaster2,Intelligence

1.	We know that the Show takes place in New York City, So that is a given
2.	From the Buildings in the back ground listed left to right:
 * 	Empire state building in Green
 *	Chrysler Building in White
 *	Citi-Group Center
 *	432 Park Ave.

 	With these building in this order, we are able to say that the East River in full View of the Camera.  There are 10 Bridges that Span the East River. 

 * Brooklyn Bridge

 * Manhattan Bridge

 * Williamsburg Bridge

 * Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge

 * Roosevelt Island Bridge

 * Triborough Bridge (Suspension Bridge)

 * Hell Gate Bridge

 * Rikers Island Bridge

 * Bronx–Whitestone Bridge

 * Throgs Neck Bridge


We can see that there are two shore lines when looking at the picture. Meaning that there is an Island in the river. Only One of the aforementioned Bridges span the width of the East River and Crosses an Island.  The Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge.  

So now we Know that we are looking At Manhattan from Queens. While being South of the Queensboro Bridge.

3.	Take note of the Roof Architecture of the Building Holmes and Watson are on.  The Roof line is not built on a 90° corner. The Majority of “Brownstone” Residential building were built from the years 1868 into the 1890s.   Not with 100% certainty I can say that most Brownstone Style Residential Building were built using 90° corners.  With this being said, the building they are on is not a residential building. Or at least the one we see them enter.

4.	We can Use Satellite Imagery Now that we know The Building is in Queens and is South of the Queensboro Bridge.
 * 	Note that the building’s roof has doors on the South side with one needed Stairs, This is not entirely unique but would aid in the viewing form great heights. 
 * 	We find ourselves at   10-10 44th Ave, Long Island City, NY 11101 Which is the Roof Used in Elementary that gives us the Iconic and Beautiful View of New York.

These scooters are clean, not muddy or beaten to hell, some have sport bike style suspension.  So most likely this is not a rural area, this is a city with smooth paved roads.

Now with all this in mind, The Designation on the top left hand corner of the tag is most likely a regional code.  After a quick look at Vietnamese Regional License Plate code I find that 41/50-59 are Reserved for one region,  Highly populated.

These lights are on horizontal structure and are not found on roads or highways, the only area I can think of for that [horizontal  structure would be a train or metro system power delivery for electric cable suspension.](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/20/nyregion/TRAIN/TRAIN-master1050.jpg) 

There seems to be a road to your far left, meaning that this block can only have a handful of building at the most.  Small block. 

Most notable is the [Citibank building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sterling+Blooms/@40.7446849,-73.9400945,507a,35y,302.71h,44.8t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258d873b3f8ed:0xa877259d01a5f7ef!8m2!3d40.7508481!4d-73.9492997) in the very middle of your photo.  Some of the building to its side are fairly new (the one the top 15 floor with the lights off has not even finished construction.

With all of this I think I can [locate your view point to somewhere in this red circle.](https://i.imgur.com/MUhjz7R.jpg)

First I would note the language on the bikes, German, fairly narrows it down to 4 Countries.  Then the Building, Saturn (a Food company in Europe, a defunct auto company in the US) Fit X work out center, and lastly the Holiday Inn. You can also see on a street sign in the background that Hamburg and Frankfurt are opposing directions, So now I Narrow my search to the largest cities between the Hamburg and Frankfurt. Berlin sticks out like a swore thumb. from there its all about narrowing down the location of the three aforementioned shops.  The Berliner Congress Center, Alexanderstraße 11, 10178 Berlin, Germany.   [within the red circle?](https://i.imgur.com/7JpEdaG.jpg)
It was a little difficult to locate since the [Saturn building Holiday Inn and Fit X are new there.](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.5208526,13.4158904,3a,75y,281.38h,101.89t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOGPDvySFJsNdiK-r-mLli6oWUAGhEUpJTBnFs8!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOGPDvySFJsNdiK-r-mLli6oWUAGhEUpJTBnFs8%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya213.44624-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352)

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do I have a chance of becoming an FBI/DEA agent or investigative analyst,"So I've been interested in a career in law enforcement for awhile now. I've been interested in being an FBI, DEA, or ATF agent, or becoming a cop in a big city and eventually becoming a detective. But, I am not sure if I am disqualified.

In the fall I was prescribed SSRI (zoloft) by a psychiatrist for anxiety and for intrusive thoughts (mainly about bad experiences I had in the past, bad things that happened to me in the past, and bad things that could potentially happen in the future). I suffered from anxiety for a lot of my life, and while suffering from anxiety and intrusive thoughts I was high functioning (doing well academically in high school and playing sports in high school, getting high grades in college, doing well in my first job out of college). I had been doing therapy on and off since pretty early on in college, but I felt like it wasn't working as well as it could have because I still was having mental tension. So, I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me SSRI and it has been working well.

Like I said I've been able to function well in society. I had a 3.7 G.P.A in college as a Political Science and Spanish major, am now a Masters student and have a 3.9 G.P.A. (my major is Secondary Education History), and I have no real gaps in the resume.

I am unsure if going on a psych med disqualifies me from being a federal agent or local police officer. If it does, would it also disqualify me from being an FBI Investigative analyst or a DEA Investigative analyst?

I have written a lot of papers throughout my academic career, so writing intelligence reports or investigative reports in a timely fashion would not be a problem for me. I can also speak Spanish quite well and am a History buff, and I think these things could be a plus in being an analyst. I am reading about the analyst positions and they sound pretty interesting too.

Post-Military Job Opportunity Questions,"Hello everyone, I am currently enlisted in the US Navy and work in the (SIGINT) intel community. This is a throw away account, just due to the nature of my work and clearance. I have a current TS/SCI (with CI poly) and a clean record. After high school I went to college for a few years, got my associates degree in general science, and joined the navy. I joined because I wanted to serve my country, but also use it as a stepping stone to get into the intel community. I’m going to try and finish out my degree while I’m in the navy, so I can transition directly into the job I’m wanting. My dream is to be an Operations Officer with the CIA, it sounds a bit far-fetched, but really I think I have all the qualities needed to fit the job. Clandestine work is what really interests me, I think HUMINT would be right up my alley. If I needed to work my way up, Ive considered working for the FBI as a SA or working for the NSA. By the time I’m out of the military I’ll be around 26 if I choose not to re-enlist.

My question is, with the work experience that I have, what are my odds of being accepted as a CIA Operations Officer/FBI SA/NSA? I’m not sure if this is the best subreddit to post to, but hopefully someone can give me a little bit of insight. Thank you for the help!",CantStayImAThrowaway,Intelligence

Extensive Travel and Employment Opportunities,"Good evening,

A little bit of background: I am currently in the military and have wanted to do an extended overseas backpacking trip for quite a while. However, I have always wanted to work within the Intelligence Community since I was young. With my current contract, I should be well set up to begin working within the IC immediately upon exiting the military. 

In a perfect world, I would like to be able to backpack to many different countries for 2+ months before beginning work. I understand that travel can lengthen a security clearance background check, and certain countries may raise red flags if traveled to. Would an overseas backpacking trip (Europe, India, SE Asia) make me less competitive upon finishing my service, and if so, would this be due to being unemployed for an extended time or due to extensive travel?

I have no problem putting travel off in order to begin working, but if it is possible and won't hinder me professionally, then I would definitely travel. Any insight is appreciated! Thank you.",PearlKrabs97,Intelligence

Question about United States SF 86 form,"I have a question about the SF 86 form, a form that one is required to fill out in the application process for many federal law enforcement jobs.

It appears that on the SF 86 form, the definition of terrorism is very broad. Here it is: ""For the purpose of this question, terrorism is defined as any criminal acts that involve violence or are dangerous to human life and appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.""

For example, by this definition of terrorism, doesn't that mean that the US government has advocated and committed acts of terrorism before? For example, about 5 or 6 years ago, the United States armed and trained the Free Syrian Army to overthrow the Syrian government. The Free Syrian Army attacked Syrian military installations and assassinated leaders of the Syrian military. So, by this definition of terrorism, doesn't that mean that the United States government was ""advocating acts of terrorism?""

Also, if one is looking back at historical conflicts that already happened right now in 2020, such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and one reads about an incident in the early 1990s in which an IRA unit fired machine guns at an unmanned RUC station one night (the RUC were Northern Ireland's sectarian police force that were notorious for human rights abuses, assassinations, and colluding with Protestant and Loyalist terrorist groups who terrorized and killed Catholic civilians) in a town that was nearly 100% Catholic and did not welcome the RUC presence, if one wrote on reddit or told a group of people on an anniversary of the incident that they thought the IRA's actions were justified at the time, is that considered ""advocating acts of terrorism,"" or when the form asks ""Have you advocated any acts of terrorism?,"" is that just asking if you were ever encouraging for something to happen that hadn't happened yet?

Thanks for any answers.",YoungDream14,Intelligence

CORONA VIRUS Premortem Analysis - Impact of US Government stopping all direct in-bound and out-bound flights to China,"This week Randy Pherson (Co-author Structured Analytical Techniques), offered a novel analytical method to assess the impact of policy decisions **before** they've actually been implemented. 

**Premortem Analysis** asks Intelligence analysts to assess the outcome of a decision before it happens!

Ok, so imagine the impact if the US Government stops all direct flights in and out of China. 

Fast forward two months - 

Todays' date is 12 April 2020, we're now two months into the Government Policy to cancel all direct flights in and out of mainland china - **What are the impacts for the US?** 

General population - 

Hospitals - 

Transportation disruptions - 

Impact on commerce - 

Financial services?

My thoughts: Chinese will continue to leave the mainland as the Corona Virus continues to spread. They will seek nations with high standards of health and living, such as the US, Canada, UK, and Australia arriving via flights from Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Mexico, the UAE and Turkey to avoid the embargo on direct flights, this increases the potential spread from Chinese nationals making the containment and quarantine of affected people difficult. 

Significant impacts to Chinese manufacturing, and in turn a downturn in imports could create a stall in the economy. Tourism from China would all but cease...

Could we have non-partisan discussion about who's asset Trump is.,"All politics and opinions aside.
Trump is an asset for someone when it comes global money laundering and financial crime.
Start with this

 https://quodverum.com/2019/03/75/endgame-potus-trump-s-vindication-nears.html there are links to specific FBI reports.

It goes back to the 80's. Now we have pretty good links that the whole Biden affair, really isn't about Biden. But the way Burisma/Mykola Zlochevsky was laundering money through Burisma&gt;cyprus&gt;eastern europe&gt; london and Hunter was just one of the bagman who accidentally was exposed due to good 'ol fashioned US election mudslinging. 

Now we've got the Brothers Vindman. We're hearing all about the 2 in the news. We don't hear anything about brother #3 Leonid Vindman. Here's where it gets interesting again. Corruption and money laundering. He's a money mover, he's been investigate, and most likely he'll link back to the ""Troika Laundromat"", Ukraine, Russia and Cyprus. He's got connections and I would not be surprised if he shows up linked to British Royal charities and our favorite ex president's foundation. 

I can see a lot of the trails all going back to a large european network , like panama papers 2.0.  Trump always seems to pop up as a possible informant in these, whether it's to save his own ass or get favors I don't know or care at the moment.  But it's pretty clear he's someone's go to CI. I used to think it was the FBI, but these days I'm not so sure it's anyone domestic. It's got to be the IMF , one of the FED owners or someone similar.",raka_defocus,Intelligence

Estimates on my IQ score?,"I've always wanted to take a professional IQ test by a psychologist because those are the only reliable sources, but my family can't afford them and there are no testing centers where I live. I know that IQ tests are all over the place, so I disregard those scores. I was hoping you guys could give me some estimates on my IQ by analyzing my accomplishments. I know I'm above average, but I don't know if I surpass 110, 120, or 130.

Junior in HS. Top of every class (always 95%+ on stem tests). 6 AP classes (this year). 4.0 GPA. 1600 SAT (2 months study), 36 ACT (no study). 800 on Math II and Chemistry Subject Tests (2 months study each). I've never struggled in any level of stem class, though history always gave me pain (I average B-'s on my APUSH exams). I am always the one people ask for help in math and science. AP CS A, AP Calc, AP Physics, and AP Chem was a breeze for me, I did not struggle much at all and got 5's.

I took a Mensa practice test and got a 125, and I was wondering if that was a reasonable score. I remember me being in a very bad condition but I still wanted to take it, ended up rushing through it and finishing a few minutes early because I was so tired. 

Not trying to brag or anything, these accomplishments aren't that good if you compare it to other high-tier students, but what IQ range do you think I fit in? My dad is 160 and in Mensa, don't know about my mom (above average though).

I wish someone correlated IQ with high school accomplishments and difficulty (i.e. taking normal classes and being challenged could be 100)

Writing to you all today on reddit since I figured you all would have the best information available.
I'm currently a freshman at The University of Texas in Austin and my major is Eastern European International Affairs. And I have some questions I'm hoping someone could clear up.
•My major requires me to study abroad in Russia/Poland, I intend on doing both but I was concerned that spending time in Eastern Europe would hinder my ability to get a security clearance.
•Are there any specific fed jobs/military that would use my area of focusing being Eastern Europe or is that something given with time in the field in general? 
•Apart of me is telling me I should quit college and do a coding camp at UT and go Airborne ISR, would it just be better to go through with college to go to OTS? 
•What sort of career mobility is there in the intelligence world? 
•Furthermore any advise would be greatly appreciated

Career guidance,"I am seeking input on where to steer my career. 


I have 10 years of work experience, 9 of which is professional in nature. I hold a BS in Engineering, as well as a TS/SCI/Poly that is due for a reup in 3 years. I spent 7 of the last 9 years with a top 5 defense contractor doing software development. Following a relocation to Alexandria, VA, the past 2 years have been with a top 20 defense contractor doing the same work.


I have had a very successful career thus far, but frankly, I have become extremely bored with doing the same thing for so long. I need a change of scenery, a faster pace, an opportunity to learn something new, and an environment where I can do more meaningful work. I am very analytical, enjoy difficult challenges, and am most motivated when I know that what I am working on will make an adversary chase their tail wondering how we achieved what we did.


I know I am good at solving challenging logical problems, so utilizing that skill in a new way seems like a sensible path forward. I am not sure if that means something like an analyst role, doing programming in a different realm, or something else entirely different that I havent even thought of. I have often felt the urge to learn a foreign language, so I dont know if that could somehow factor into an new position. 


I received an offer for a 0132 Intelligence GG-13 Step 01 position last year, but I turned it down, as it was a $50k pay cut and was heavily focused on research work. I would rather be on the operational side of the spectrum than the R&amp;D side. I also have no idea as to if a government position or a contractor position is the right thing for me. Any suggestions on what sort of position I should seek out? What sort of skills should I build to get such a position?",PoorNoName,Intelligence

I am currently working as a help desk technician/network admin as active duty military and have the opportunity to go to university part time. I am not satisfied working on troubleshooting computer hardware and software and want to switch career paths to something more analytical/big picture. The only problem is I don’t know the name of the job that I want or what organization offers this opportunity. 
I am interested in working for law enforcement on the cyber side of things, ie. investigating and eliminating crimes on the dark web as well as surface level networks. Anything from fraud, to human trafficking to drug trading. I’m not a good public speaker so I don’t want to be giving briefs or anything like that, so maybe less of an intelligence role but more of a behind the scenes analyst/investigative role. Is there a certain degree or cert that will help me get to this dream job? Any practical advice or steps I could take? What Is the job title for this? Cyber security analyst? NSA or CIA?

"Graduated May 2019, B.S. in Poli-sci with Minor in Natsec/Intelligence, need advice on if I should go for a Masters now or do a Post-Bacc/Second BS before a Masters.","Hey guys, I don't know anyone I can talk to about this so that's why I'm here. 

Ending GPA was 3.73, but no international experience and no research experience. Minimal volunteer experience.

I lack all three due to affordability, I worked full-time otherwise I would have starved, older student (I'm now 29, close to 30), so I at least have good amounts of work experience and would have good professional references if I needed it.

I also financially took care of a parent during my time in so that also stressed my priority to work as opposed to do a study abroad or something to supplement my academic experience. There was one or two research opportunities I encountered but pay was low, or non-existent, and I couldn't afford to quit or work around my full-time job. 

Due to medical history, military isn't really an option. If I'm being honest with myself....I really don't think I'm cut out for the military. 

Some things have changed over the past year and I'm now in a better position to have more freedom to move around without needing to put my family first. Wish I coulda did that during undergrad. I've just been working full-time since graduating so I can pay off some debt and save money for more education. I want to go for a masters and maybe get additional experience related to my chosen field (wanting to in national security in some way, preferably intelligence analysis) to help me be more competitive.

Should I just go for a Masters? Or maybe find a post-bacc or related BS to add? I was looking at the SRA program at Penn State, there wasn't a whole lot of analysis/security-based courses to take at my school.

Canada has proof passenger plane was shot down Iranian forces.,"( Hypothetical question. )  


So Canada claims it has proof Iran shot down the passenger airliner.  


So far ; they play it off as being a 'mistake' , an 'accident' that took place. ( Perhaps  ) .  


Examining things deeper, could the possibility exist that the Iranian Regime attempted to stage a false flag event ?  


I would examine the times at which the airliner was descended versus the missile launch against the bas in Iraq.  

( In retrospect to the above comments it did seem Trump was  aware of said facts... In said address to the nation last night.. that the downed airliner carrying innocent men women and children of various nationalities, was perpetrated by the Iran regime...  these Monsters have no regard for life... nor freedom. )

Does anyone know of any companies that may do ‘advisory’ work on for private entities or foreign entities in relation to counterintelligence or surveillance. 

I feel like I may be looking with the wrong search terms in my job search. If anyone has any tips for either a company or freelance work in the intelligence field as described above. Please let me know, as I’m a bit confused as to where I’m going wrong.",miffed_analyst,Intelligence

Surveillance state and the creeper who watches you.,"# Surveillance state and the creeper who watches you.

&amp;#x200B;

In the United States alone there is an estimated 30 million cameras shooting 4 billion hours of footage every single day. Now, if you take into account all the other countries and privately owned security cameras this number is astronomical.

With this many security cameras around the world and most being privately owned I question the privacy to ones self and to those who happen to find themselves in-font of one.

I set out to research camera makes and models and realised that all cameras on a network are easy accessible to anybody who cares to dig for information to access them.

The more I researched the more I worried about the risks and privacy to the people and properties that were under surveillance.

**Below are 3 examples of security cameras that are running on a server with no password protection and open to me, you, thieves, terrorists and anybody who cares to look.**

Doing my own intelligence?,"Hi, I'm looking for some pointers, advice, getting started tips on doing intelligence work. Not in a professional capacity, but as an amateur hobbyist.  I'm just a concerned citizen who wants to explore threats and opportunities to myself and my nation in general. Furthermore, I feel like it would be intellectually stimulating for myself since I have broad interests in foreign policy, military, and technology subjects. I always find it inspiring when I hear stories about folks on the internet who find out about things going on around the world just by doing research and connecting the dots. I've been thinking about starting by just making my own database and getting sources from readily available print and digital media. Or starting a blog where I can share my own logical analysis and opinions. Thanks for any insight.",ayreon93,Intelligence

"Phreesia, a healthcare company, tied to Ascension/Google Nightingale, just conducted a 2nd IPO which is being underwritten by Allen &amp; Co (and a few other USIC connected firms)","According to [this article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191210006054/en/Phreesia-Announces-Secondary-Offering) Phreesia is selling another 6 million shares, but not too generate cash for the company, just for it's investors.  This is 6 short months after their [1st IPO in June](https://www.cfo.com/ipos/2019/06/health-care-software-maker-phreesia-files-for-125-million-ipo/).  Immediately after the 2nd IPO, it's stock went up 40%.

[This article from 2010](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/phreesia-to-accelerate-growth-with-16-million-investment-led-by-ascension-health-ventures-94822664.html) indicates they are utilizing the same Ascension data, that [Google's Project Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Nightingale) was using.  The same project that is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for opt-out violations of HIPAA, to the potential tune of $540 Trillion in fines.

The mainstream media hasn't published anything about the Ascension connection, and I suspect it's because of some heavy weight investors behind this company.  One of the underwriters for both IPO's is the infamous Allen &amp; Co, who notoriously arranges backroom deals for media/social media/propaganda companies (see [Mockingbird X.0](https://old.reddit.com/r/Intelligence/comments/bacrym/mockingbird_x0/)).  Their long-term interest in this company may be related to their overall strategy of owning a piece of all the propaganda tools in the U.S.

Keep in mind, the health data Phreesia works with would greatly reduce the need for using social media harvesting systems to identify targets for psychological warfare operations, similar to Cambridge Analytica/SCL.  Revelations by Chris Wylie in his new book [Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/604375/mindfck-by-christopher-wylie/), shows us that big data analytics can be used to exploit health data both for political and financial purposes.  By triggering addiction cycles and exploiting the resulting increase in cognitive biases, Cambridge Analytica got Trump elected and Brexit passed.

Cambridge Analytica was able to identify targets with a simple Facebook survey.  Imagine what they could do with precise medical diagnoses like Phreesia would have access too.",webdoodle,Intelligence

The Truth about the FBI USPS idHSC Voluntary Fingerprint Submission Program,"There’s a lot of confusion around the Internet about the FBI’s recently announced idHSC program (seen by some as ldHSC), where you can voluntarily submit your fingerprints at the post office (USPS) to find out what agencies have associated with your fingerprints.  This hasn’t been helped by the fact that the link that the FBI gave out on Twitter for more information ([edo.cjis.gov](https://edo.cjis.gov)) fails, and that on tiny screens the “i” of idHSC can look like an “l” as in “ldHSC”! 

[https://www.theinternetpatrol.com/the-truth-about-the-fbi-usps-idhsc-voluntary-fingerprint-submission-program/](https://www.theinternetpatrol.com/the-truth-about-the-fbi-usps-idhsc-voluntary-fingerprint-submission-program/)",amitchell,Intelligence
OIG Report: Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation,"Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf



Attorney General William P. Barr issued the following statement:

""Nothing is more important than the credibility and integrity of the FBI and the Department of Justice.  That is why we must hold our investigators and prosecutors to the highest ethical and professional standards.  The Inspector General’s investigation has provided critical transparency and accountability, and his work is a credit to the Department of Justice.  I would like to thank the Inspector General and his team.

The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken.  It is also clear that, from its inception, the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory.  Nevertheless, the investigation and surveillance was pushed forward for the duration of the campaign and deep into President Trump’s administration.  In the rush to obtain and maintain FISA surveillance of Trump campaign associates, FBI officials misled the FISA court, omitted critical exculpatory facts from their filings, and suppressed or ignored information negating the reliability of their principal source.  The Inspector General found the explanations given for these actions unsatisfactory.  While most of the misconduct identified by the Inspector General was committed in 2016 and 2017 by a small group of now-former FBI officials, the malfeasance and misfeasance detailed in the Inspector General’s report reflects a clear abuse of the FISA process.

FISA is an essential tool for the protection of the safety of the American people.  The Department of Justice and the FBI are committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to rectify the abuses that occurred and to ensure the integrity of the FISA process going forward.

No one is more dismayed about the handling of these FISA applications than Director Wray.  I have full confidence in Director Wray and his team at the FBI, as well as the thousands of dedicated line agents who work tirelessly to protect our country.  I thank the Director for the comprehensive set of proposed reforms he is announcing today, and I look forward to working with him to implement these and any other appropriate measures.

With respect to DOJ personnel discussed in the report, the Department will follow all appropriate processes and procedures, including as to any potential disciplinary action.""

“I have the utmost respect for the mission of the Office of Inspector General and the comprehensive work that went into the report prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff.  However, our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department.  Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.  Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.”

"Hypothesis: Haroon K. Ullah, former advisor to the secretary of state, is being arbitrarily imprisoned by the United States for intending to publish a book that reveals how the heroin network in Pakistan helps fund United States covert ops or Islamist proxy forces in the region.","Book in question is ""House of Heroin"": [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1538551152/ref=dbs\_a\_def\_rwt\_bibl\_vppi\_i4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1538551152/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4) 

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062463993/ref=pe\_861660\_435205480\_fxm\_3\_0\_i\_id](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062463993/ref=pe_861660_435205480_fxm_3_0_i_id)

&amp;#x200B;

I pre-ordered this book from Amazon in early 2018/late 2017, at which time the book was scheduled to be published in 3/4 months. The book's release was postponed in Amazon about 4 times, until the end where my order was canceled. 

In July 2019, this author was  sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for ""overcharging the government by US$40k"" via falsified documents, etc. For the record, 40,000 is a very minor sum for a published individual that works in the government, I am sure he would have preferred and been able to pay a fine. This is all conjecture, but I found that there is a precedent for the security establishment to go to lengths to obscure (look into ""The Politics of Heroin"" by Alfred McCoy and ""Dark Alliance"" by Gary Webb) reports linking drugs to covert ops. I find the possibility that law is being selectively enforced to censure information too possible.

Getting Into Intelligence,"I know, this question has been asked before. But, I've read the similar questions previously asked and didn't see  comments on details relative to my situation so I wanted to make a post anyways.

Graduating undergrad in the U.S. with a high 3.9 GPA in business admin. Got a first job starting very soon working in an operations team of the investments and trust sector of a regional bank in a big city. Have grown an interest in intel, specifically financial intel like FinCEN or CIA's Economic Analyst, the past few years but still wanting to get some banking/finance experience in said big city before I attempt breaking into the intel field. 

The job is willing to help pay for masters level work so long as it applies to banking so an online MBA is an option for further resume building. (Have even found some programs focused specifically on banking) Seems like an MBA isn't the worst thing to pursue but there may better options based on Reddit comments, namely language proficiency. 

So say I get banking experience over the next 5 or so years maybe less, get an MBA and work on language proficiency on the side (did well at Spanish in undergrad). Would this be a good track to apply for something like FinCEN or a CIA Economic Analyst? Or any kind of financially-related intel analyst position with the federal government really? What all can I be doing now over the next few years to make myself stand out knowing I want to pursue this specific type of analysis later on?

Thanks.",Blades418,Intelligence

The Democratic Congresswoman is said to have passed information to Qatar which was subsequently handed along to Iran.

https://www.jpost.com/American-Politics/Ilhan-Omar-working-for-Qatar-Florida-court-hears-609003

&gt;Ilhan Omar was recruited by a foreign government, received funding from a foreign government, and passed sensitive information through intermediates to Iran, a Florida court has been told.

&gt;The claims came during testimony by Kuwati-born Canadian businessman Alan Bender, who was giving evidence in the trial of Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad al-Thani. The Qatari emir's brother stands accused of ordering his American bodyguard to murder two people, and of holding an American citizen hostage. His deposition, obtained by Al Arabiya English, was authenticated by the attorney for the plaintiffs, according to the publication.

Qatari Intelligence Involved in Crimes by Brother of Tamim

https://7dnews.com/news/qatari-intelligence-involved-in-crimes-by-brother-of-tamim

&gt;Media sources reported that Al Masnad confirmed to Bender that everything that happened in this case is true. The legal letter read: “can you please provide details about the trip that Mr. Alan Bender, a Canadian businessman, took to Doha from 18-21 June? Did Bender meet with His Excellency Sheikh Mohammad Al Masnad? Did His Excellency Sheikh Mohammad Al Masnad confirm the details that my clients have included in their civil complaints against His Excellency Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani?” asked the letter.

Qatar should not mediate between Iran and the US

criticism for supporting the wrong side of Somalia (Al-Shabaab
terrorists’) and not focusing on the radicalization of Jihadists in
her own constituency.

Eddie Gallagher is not a war criminal. Prosecutors illegally spied on defense's communications. Witnesses were bribed. Another person admitted to the murder. Check the facts before spreading misinformation.,"Lead Navy prosecutor in SEAL war crime case out over email spying

https://www.navytimes.com/news/2019/06/04/lead-navy-prosecutor-in-seal-war-crime-case-out-over-email-spying/

&gt;Navy Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak was ordered off the case against Special Warfare Operator Chief Edward “Eddie” Gallagher by the judge, Navy Capt. Aaron Rugh, on Monday after Czaplak admitted emailing 13 defense attorneys and paralegals, as well as Navy Times editor Carl Prine, a tracking beacon in an effort to find the source of leaks to the media.

First SEAL to complain about Gallagher first to get weapons permit

https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2019/jul/12/ticker-first-seal-complain-gallagher-first-get/#

&gt;In spite of testimony that a half dozen Navy SEAL witnesses who agreed to testify against Navy Special Operations Chief Ed Gallagher were offered permits to carry concealed weapons, only one permit has been issued.

The prosecutor, himself, filled out the paperwork for his witnesses to get special concealed carry permits for exotic weapons. Witnesses were also handed out promotions.

Despite the attempt to frame Gallagher for murder, the story is clear. A young enemy combatant barely survived an explosion that killed many others, was captured, was suffering from extreme pulmonary trauma, where the medics attempted a tracheotomy. When the local Iraqi militia showed up to take the dying prisoner, a person other than Gallagher, asphyxiated him to save him from torture by the Iraqis.

This court case reflects an internal struggle within the SEAL's that Bill McRaven's legacy left behind because he loved Obama and hated Trump. There is no place for that BS in the military. The only reason the Bin Laden raid happened is because people ignored orders to stand down. Some military leaders are borderline treasonous in their actions and are in clear violation of the UCMJ.

Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher not guilty of murder in ISIS detainee's death

https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/eddie-gallagher-navy-seal-trial-verdict/index.html

&gt;Decorated Navy SEAL team leader Eddie Gallagher was acquitted of nearly all charges in the death of an ISIS prisoner in Iraq, including premeditated murder.

Is SEAL war crimes suspect Eddie Gallagher innocent?

&gt;According to the defense motion, the SEAL’s words offer “a significantly exculpatory alternative theory” of the boy’s death, information so significant that it promises to “completely eviscerate” the prosecution’s theory of the case and “explains why so many of the witnesses are reticent to fully tell their stories.""

Medic testifies that he killed ISIS prisoner of war, not Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher

https://www.kusi.com/medic-testifies-that-he-not-navy-seal-eddie-gallagher-killed-the-isis-prisoner-of-war/

&gt;Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher’s defense speak to reporters after bombshell testimony from Special Operator 1st Class Corey Scott who said he asphyxiated the ISIS fighter.

Pentagon asks for Navy secretary resignation over SEAL controversy,"From the top. There are five names you should know:

[Eddie Gallagher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Gallagher_(Navy_SEAL), a Navy SEAL, accused of war crimes,

Several spots above him is [Rear Adm Collin Green](https://taskandpurpose.com/tag/rear-adm-collin-green), who oversees the SEALs and has made [solving order and discipline problems a priority](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/455891-top-navy-seal-warns-commanders-of-order-and-discipline-problem)

A few spots above him sits [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_V._Spencer), who is was Secretary of the Navy,

Above him is [Mark Esper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Esper), who is the Secretary of Defense,

who reports to Donald Trump, the President of the United States and Commander in Chief

​
  • Gallagher was accused of various war crimes by several of his own men, was tried and was exonerated on all but one count.

  • Recently, Donald Trump commuted Gallagher's sentence.

  • Earlier this week Spencer reported that the Navy was reviewing the Gallagher case, and this review that might lead Gallagher to be ejected from the Seals. Historically, these reviews have almost never ended favorably for the individual in question.
  
  • Trump became aware of this and tweeted that Gallagher would not face these consequences.

  • Spencer stated that ""a tweet is not an order"", and that the review would continue.

  • Various media report that Spencer and Green - both of whom are presumably interested in protecting the institutional integrity of the Navy - have threatened to resign if the review is halted. This would have been a significant, historic rebuke. Spencer publicly denies this. Green has not commented publicly, but other officials deny it on his behalf.

  • Tonight: Spencer is fired by Esper. Esper's justification: Spencer went behind his back and proposed a ""sham review"" to the WH, where Gallagher would ultimately be exonerated. This story does not match up with Spencer's earlier public statements supporting the review.
 
  • Esper states that the review will be cancelled, and Gallagher will retire as a SEAL. This is the outcome he claims that Spencer was pursuing through illicit means, and is the outcome that Gallagher and the President wanted. This is not the outcome that Spencer seemed to want in his public statements.

  • Esper's justification of Spencer's firing differs dramatically from Trump's (given in another series of tweets).
 
  • More importantly, Esper's story differs dramatically from Spencer's termination letter. His letter is damning, and more-or-less accuses President Trump of giving an illegal order:

“ 
Unfortunately it has become apparent that in the respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.

It's not clear what happened, but if you believe Spencer it sure sounds like Trump followed up his tweet with a formal order - perhaps to stop the review, or to force a ""sham trial"" - and Spencer refused, hence his termination.

The interesting questions for Monday are -
  • what, if anything, will Spencer say?
  • what, if anything, will Green do?

What if Cognitive Augmentation made the gap between cognitive ability wider?,"I'll submit to you the premise of the question in the form of a syllogism.

1. People differ in cognitive ability 
2. Cognitive differences are valid and measurable by measuring the activity of white brain matter.
3. One way of observing cognitive differences is measuring computational speed.
4. Cognitive Augmentation would be achieved by transferring data to/from the brain and a device.
5. If a device transmits 1000mbps to a device that can only process 100mbps, the functional bandwidth is capped at 100mbps.
6. A cognition augmenting device would operate in base logic more efficiently than the human brain in byte to byte units.
7. Understanding inspires new ideas, which would engage another send/receive sequence which result in a compounding effect.",VexxNetworks,Intelligence

Geosim is a modern-age geopolitical simulator based around the idea of establishing a niche between realism and enjoyment. Anyone can come around and claim a country and, with sufficient build-up, take it anywhere they please (within the bounds of reality). Geosim’s community, based around the [discord](https://discord.gg/mpzW79T), is quite possibly one of the most welcoming around, with practically anyone willing to help fledgling members in their journey to trailblazing a new future.  
  
Season X is up and running, and we’re currently in the year 2033. We’re looking for more people to participate as to make the world come alive even more than it already has. There are a fair few countries that are open as well as a few application countries, so make sure to take a look!  
  
###Frequently Asked Questions  
  
**What is the scope of my claim?**  
  
Geosim preserves some pretense of countries as independent actors on the world stage. Your claim can only say what happens in your country. You can roleplay as your politicians in whatever fashion you can think of, gradually cause shifts and changes in party popularity (as well as create new parties), and of course have your government effect new legislation. Terrorist attacks are where it gets more questionable, with this being decided on a case-by-case basis.  
  
You cannot make a post describing another country doing something proactively (if the other country makes a post about it it’s fine). You cannot dictate how another country responds to what you do. Where’d be the fun in that?  
  
 
**What are the limits of this new reality?**  
  
Realism is of great value in Geosim. You can’t simply buy an aircraft carrier as Nigeria, or, as Brazil, declare war on Paraguay because they begin to lean towards Argentina more. In order to preserve the sanctity of the simulation, some actions will be outright invalidated (a move usually reserved for the worst of the worst), and some actions will need significant build-up in order to get anywhere (stuff like civil wars or elections of new parties).
  
**How does economics as a whole work?**  
  
Every country makes a budget the standard source for numbers is the IMF databank.  
  
As for international economics, we (try to) make posts showing regional growth trends, the business cycle, recessions, and other things. Our economic moderators inform you of how your economic policies should affect things on your budget, and also ensure you’re not doing anything absolutely horrible that will make your entire economy fall apart in seconds.  
  
**How does the UN work?**  
   
UNGA propositions can really only do things like *condemn* actions, but every country can vote on UNGA propositions. UNSC propositions need to be sponsored by somebody on the Security Council, can enact sanctions and the like, can only be voted on by countries on the security council, and can be vetoed by the P5.  
  
The UNSC list selection is done every few years and biased towards claimed countries, diminishing realism but improving player participation.  
  
**What’s a ModEvent?**  
  
ModEvents are events made by moderators to spice things up. They can feature natural disasters, political unrest, punishments for doing stupid things that aren’t stupid enough to invalidate, and just about anything else you can think of. Players can propose ideas for ModEvents through modmail, and, upon approval, be allowed to write and post it (after the mods review the final draft).  
  
**Expansions?**   
  
Expansions are one of the few moderator-sanctioned concessions of realism in geosim. They allow countries to annex other countries, or form a union. The system isn’t complicated, but it’ll take 10-20 posts to complete usually, so it can be a struggle for newer players. The difficulty is variable though, and some (usually pretty stupid) expansions can be ruled out entirely. Historically based expansions are the most common and condoned.  
  
**How do wars work?**  
  
Wars are pretty simple. All sides get time to make conflict posts detailing their plans. If one side doesn’t make a conflict post moderators create their own battle plan for them. Moderators then take both sides and curate how each offensive goes, and sums all that up in a battle post. A reform of this system is underway, and so you’ll probably see something different whenever the season actually begins. Keep an eye out!   
  
Civil wars can work differently. If a player so desires, moderators allow them to make their own battle posts detailing how the civil war goes in their own country. Moderators check to see if anything is stupid, and if nothing is stupid, then the battle post is officially endorsed.  
  
**How long are posts, usually?**  
  
It depends. Newer people usually submit about one paragraph or two, and once they see some of the longer posts submitted by seasoned players, they gradually make their posts longer. An average post length would be around 400-600 words, with longer posts stretching to 1,000 words and beyond (Don’t worry, there’s no pressure to write an essay with each post. Go at your own pace).  
  
  **What is rollme?**  
  
Rollme is a dice rolling bot that is mainly used for secrecy and expansion posts, but can also be used for whatever the player wants it to do. You can find a guide for its use [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/wiki/rollme). There are also more complex guides found [here](https://wiki.roll20.net/Dice_Reference).  
  
**How do secrecy posts work?**  
  
Secrecy posts are divided into two types: Ones that requires rolls and ones that do not. The latter usually refers to roleplay posts that the player doesn’t want people to know about. The former refers to the really fun ones, where secret operations are conducted. For the former, a moderator gives the player a roll through rollme that the player has to succeed in. If they don’t, the operation fails. Other countries can request discovery rolls on the operation, and there is also a standard discovery roll that all secrecy posts undergo.  
  
Discovery rolls are where the system gets complex, with a limited number of public discovery rolls available (harder, but produces publicly available evidence) as well as an unlimited number of private discovery rolls (easier, but cannot be shared with other countries). You can learn more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/wiki/secrecy).  
  
  
____________________ 
  

  
The questions below are done in a quickfire manner.  
  
**How secret are diplomacy posts?**  
  
Secret unless otherwise stated.  
  
**How do players communicate?**  
  
[Discord!](https://discord.gg/Hm9FVwJ)  
  
**How can I find what countries are claimed?**  
  
You can find it on the [player list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/wiki/players)!
  
**What are application countries?**  
  
Application countries require an application. They are composed of the P5. When there are no applicants for a set amount of time they can be claimed like any other country.  
  
**How do I get a flair?**  
  
You should only do this when you claim a country. Near the top of the sidebar there is text that says “Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:” and then shows your username and (edit). Click on edit. Find the flag of your country. Click on it, and save it. If you’re on mobile you can’t do that, so ask a mod and they’ll do it for you.  
  
**What’s the timescale?**  
  
1 week = 1 year. Its kind of awkward, but it works. If you get confused, automod posts daily to tell you the month.

BlackSky secures $50M in funding from Intelsat,"https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/blacksky-secures-50m-in-funding-from-intelsat/

The new capital will allow BlackSky to augment existing assets and alliances, ensuring BlackSky remains a
leader in delivering actionable Earth intelligence faster, with greater
accuracy and more affordably than anyone else in the industry. Over time,
BlackSky could incorporate access to Intelsat’s robust global communications
infrastructure, delivering first-to-know insights to customers no matter where
in the world they are.



“BlackSky is enabling a whole new level of global intelligence by leveraging the economics of small satellites so that our customers will always be the first to know,” said Brian O’Toole, president and CEO of BlackSky. “It takes a lot of expertise, engineering and capital to make smallsats viable; BlackSky is the first company to overcome these challenges with proven economies of scale. This latest partnership is a vote of confidence in our ability to deliver industry leading insights to our customers from one of the biggest players in the market.”



“BlackSky is well positioned to be a significant player in the expanding earth observation sector, which we believe benefits from accelerating trends including cloud computing, change detection, predictive analytics and machine learning. We believe a significant number of commercial and government sector customers will increasingly rely on geospatial intelligence,” said Intelsat CEO Stephen Spengler. “Our investment will be used to fund enhancements to the current BlackSky infrastructure and will serve as a springboard for a commercial alliance with Intelsat and our Intelsat General government subsidiary.”",The_Web_Of_Slime,Intelligence

Soldiers with top-secret clearances say they were forced to use an app that could endanger them,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/11/12/soldiers-with-top-secret-clearances-were-forced-use-an-app-that-could-endanger-them-they-say/

In late October, the commander of Fort Hood’s 504th Military Intelligence Brigade told her soldiers a new app could solve a lot of their communication issues.

It could relay information on weather, training changes and other logistics, Army Col. Deitra L. Trotter said. She then told the soldiers to download it onto their personal smartphones, according to the Texas-based soldiers in the unit.

But the soldiers — many of whom hold top-secret clearances with jobs in interrogation, human intelligence and counterintelligence — soon noticed that the app’s terms of service said it could collect substantial personal data and that the developer has a presence overseas.
That prompted concerns that sensitive data of intelligence soldiers could be harnessed by adversary governments, putting individuals and missions worldwide at risk, soldiers in the unit told The Washington Post.

“We do top-secret work,” said one noncommissioned officer, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution by their chain of command. “If our personal information is being put out there to a foreign power, what can they get from our brigade?”
Intelligence soldiers specialize in siphoning enemy communications and groom sources to deliver information about their foes, like their location and what weapons or capabilities they may have.


When they deploy, some soldiers grow their hair out and wear civilian clothes to obscure their military roles and don’t disclose their work outside of close family, another noncommissioned officer in the 504th said.

The app’s permissions — which suggested it could pull GPS location data, photos, contacts and even rewrite memory cards — frustrated soldiers who have taken extreme precautions they felt were glossed over by Trotter and other senior leaders.

“Just being in intelligence, we are trained to be extremely paranoid of everything,” the soldier said. “This is serious operational security not being considered.”

The worst-case scenario, he said, was “our cover might be blown.” While the app said permissions could be disabled, the soldiers said there was a failure of confidence it was secure. Senior leaders checked the phones of subordinates to ensure they had the app installed, soldiers in the unit said.


Adversarial governments and intelligence agencies prize gateways to people who collect and manage classified information, said David Forscey, the managing director of the Aspen Institute’s Cybersecurity Group.

Sensitive information like loan debts, history of drug use or even a trail of adultery through dating apps are all pieces of information that can be used to blackmail soldiers or coerce them to hand over classified information, he said.

“One reason drug use is a question in background investigations is the U.S. wants to see what people could have to compromise you,” Forscey said.

Even if secrets gathered from a soldier aren’t apparent now, they could be useful later if correlated with other data, Forscey said.

For instance, he said, there is belief that a massive Chinese hack of U.S. security clearances may have been paired with theft of medical information in the Anthem hack to find U.S. officials with access to classified information who may also have big hospital bills — making them a prime target for exploitation.


And if a soldier leaves the military and enters the CIA or another agency, “it would be useful for China to know who they are and what they look like.”

That is why U.S. officials should balance the risk of divulging sensitive information with the potential payoff, he said, which was not clear for an app that delivers rudimentary updates, like training changes or weather cancellations.

[U.S. soldiers are revealing sensitive and dangerous information by jogging]
The app developer, Straxis LLC, is based in Tulsa but has a subsidiary in southern India. User data wasn’t stored on foreign servers and third parties do not have access to data, a company spokesperson said.

Questions about security reviews during development, what user data was collected and development costs were referred to the 504th Military Intelligence Brigade, which did not address them or make Trotter available.

The concern among service members circulated on Reddit and the Army WTF! moments Facebook page, a popular digital hangout for soldiers. Soldiers deleted the app in revolt. Trotter called another formation Wednesday to address the controversy, admonishing whomever talked about the issue online, soldiers in the unit said.

The app was later removed from both Apple’s App Store and the Google Store.

[The Facebook page ‘Vets for Trump’ was hijacked by a North Macedonian businessman. It took months for the owners to get it back.]

“We are confident that the appropriate security protocols are in place to protect our Soldiers’ personally identifiable information,” the unit said, calling the app an unclassified communications tool. Straxis, the brigade said, had developed similar apps for other units.

The app was removed for a “preplanned maintenance update” and will return to the app stores, the unit said, though it did not explain the timing of the removal right after the outcry within the unit.


On Wednesday, the brigade said the soldiers had no “formal obligation” to download the app.
A day later, it reversed course, conceding the app was originally “mandatory,” but following “further discussion and feedback” from unit soldiers, the brigade decided it would only “highly encourage” use of the app.

The soldiers also were frustrated over the legal review of an order to install an app on personal smartphones. Trotter told the soldiers it was approved by Army attorneys, they said, but it was unclear to soldiers if Trotter could mandate an app on their privately owned devices.
One soldier said he was often away from his wife, and they sent intimate photos to each other. He could not be sure if they would land onto a server monitored by his commanders.
“I don’t want someone else looking at my wife’s [breasts],” he said.

The military has recently blundered in cyberspace, including troops with fitness apps unwittingly broadcast location data at secret bases worldwide.

Russian Tory donors named in secret report
Intelligence agencies are ‘furious’ over No 10’s block on publication

Nine Russian business people who gave money to the Conservative Party are named in a secret intelligence report on the threats posed to UK democracy which was suppressed last week by Downing Street.

Oligarchs and other wealthy Tory donors were included in the report on illicit Russian activities in Britain by the cross-party intelligence and security select committee (ISC), whose publication was blocked by No 10.

Some Russian donors are personally close to the prime minister. Alexander Temerko, who has worked for the Kremlin’s defence ministry and has spoken warmly about his “friend” Boris Johnson, has gifted more than £1.2m to the Conservatives over the past seven years.

MPs on the ISC, which conducted an 18-month inquiry, were also briefed on Alexander Lebedev, the former KGB spy in London whom the last Labour government allowed to buy the London Evening Standard newspaper.

Lebedev’s son Evgeny invited Johnson when he was foreign secretary to parties at the family’s converted castle near Perugia, Italy. The future prime minister apparently travelled without the close-protection police officers that normally accompany senior ministers of state during the trip in April 2018.

The largest Russian Tory donor is Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Vladimir Chernukhin, a former ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. She paid £160,000 in return for a tennis match with Johnson and has donated more than £450,000 in the last year alone.

Britain’s intelligence agencies are understood to be “furious” at the delay in releasing the report because measures to protect sensitive information have already been taken.

It is not known whether the Tory donors are named in the public section of the report, or whether they have been included in its confidential annex, which will remain classified indefinitely.

The government’s argument that it needs more time to redact information has been dismissed by the former cabinet secretary Lord Butler, Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, and Lord Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.

Last week, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told MPs the delay was “utterly unjustifiable, unprecedented and clearly politically motivated”. She added: “I fear it is because they realise that this report will lead to other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign. What is Downing Street so worried about?”

Thornberry also raised a whistleblower’s claims regarding “relationships” that Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, made during the “mysterious three years he spent in post-communist Russia”. She said the Downing Street chief of staff allegedly met Vladislav Surkov, who is known as the “grey cardinal” of the Kremlin and has close links to Russia’s security agencies.

In the Commons, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said last week that he would not comment on security clearances, but denied the “insinuation” that No 10 was “in the grip of a Kremlin mole”.

In a letter to Thornberry last week, Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, also did not deny the unusual arrangement. “Classified information, especially intelligence, is made available only to those with the appropriate security clearance,” he wrote. “This applies to Mr Cummings and his access is appropriate for someone in his role.”

A Conservative Party spokesman said: “We cannot speculate on what may or may not be in a leaked parliamentary report.”

Andrew Gwynne, a Labour parliamentary candidate, said: “Billionaires fund the Conservative Party, so this sordid cover-up shouldn’t be surprising. The Tories blocked this report and oppose tax transparency so their billionaire backers can continue to rip us off unchallenged.

“Labour is on the side of the many, not the few, so we’ll get dirty money out of politics, introduce an oligarch levy and take on the vested interests selling out our people and public services.”",The_Web_Of_Slime,Intelligence

"What did Snowden mean when he said Laura Poitras was ""selected"" for surveillance?","&gt; ""You asked why I picked you. I didn't; you did. The surveillance you've experienced means you've been selected, a term which will mean more to you as you learn about how the modern SIGINT system works. For now, know that every border you cross, every purchase you make, every call you dial, every cell phone tower you pass, friend you keep, article you write, site you visit, subject line you type and packet you route is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited, but whose safeguards are not. Your victimization by the NSA system means that you are well aware of the threat that unrestricted, secret police pose for democracies.""

I don't know much about how the surveillance system works, so I'm wondering what exactly ""selected"" means in this context. Did the NSA decide to monitor everything she did online closely and actively? Or did she also experience physical surveillance?",csvscs,Intelligence

Looking for OSINT based Master's Degree Final Project topic suggestion,"Hello, first time in this subreddit

I came to ask for some guidance and suggestions in the form of ideas for my Master's Degree Final Project. Right now I am a student (no work), I'm a Criminologist (Degree) and I'm finishing a Master in Intelligence Analyst, being necessary the elaboration of a final project for it. 

Well, due to my curiosity and desire to learn OSINT, I acquired various courses and books, and I want the methodological basis of the work to focus on it (using OSINT techniques and tools). With this in mind, what is proving difficult for me is to choose the topic on which to do it; I can't decide or find something that will convince me 100%. 

Does anyone have any idea/topic that could have consistency and in relation to the criminological/intelligence field to perform that kind of paper with a methodology focused on the use of OSINT tools and techniques?

I'm 15. People find me extremely interesting.,"When first meeting me, I seem like a weird guy.

After, people find my thoughts extremely interesting.

I don't even notice them myself, and I don't find them interesting at all.

I guess this is the quality of a smart person.

I only have a few friends, but I wish I could have more.

I just don't want to, and I'm shy they'll reject me instantly.

I've always been shy, and I never have the confidence to go up to someone and be like ""Hey!""

That just sounds so weird. There's no reason to even do it.

So yea, sigh.

I could make every friendship I could, but that requires me to first get beat up, and then they'll find me interesting and start talking to me.

And even then my shyness will only make me more stupid

I'm depressed :C

I wish school was never a thing.

Even redditors hate me. Nearly every single post I have is below a 50%.

;C

I'm autistic?

If I had autism, which I'm sure I have, I would be 5x more happier.

At least it's a condition, and not happiness lost.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But even then, I remember me talking so loudly with my friend about interesting topics.

No one even heard me except for that kid called Ethan that looks bored and looks like has autism.

Maybe no one heard me? Everyone on my snapchat posts saw my stories, and all of them had a changed attitude towards me.

Some wanted to start a streak with me (WHICH I THINK IS SO FUCKING DUMB) because there's no point in being more and more depressed from other people's happy lives which you aren't getting and doing a squiggly s with your finger and then spamming every single person. SERIOUSLY WHY IS IT FUN???

I'm so depressed. But even then I don't think I can live a happy life because everyone who saw my snapchat stories weren't like texting me a lot the next day either.

And text = aquittance.

person i can feel comfortable talking to and we talk like we text = friend.

but no ones gotten to the text stage, so no one likes me.

and then im no longer depressed, because i understand that i dont deserve any friends regardless.

theres no unbreakable wall standing between me and a party.

and even then my shyness sometimes creeps up on me so that i lose track on my thoughts and i start becoming dumber.

and then im no longer myself, but people like me better when im shy because that reduces autism.

but this isnt myself either.

this is a person who has sat still and went shy, and gone to school, and sleep deprived himself.

this is myself - just much dumber, and much more different acting.

&amp;#x200B;

i forgot what else to say. please disvote because i depressed myself to reduce autism ;C.

please say im just an attention seeker and i love being depressed because that gets me attention.

all i want is just a few friends to hang out with, and not feel awkward sitting around at lunch with for 4 years of my high school life.

maybe a few more, all i want is to not feel bad about sitting at lunch somewhere.

i dont want to sit with the same people for 4 years.

i just want to be appreciated. to deserve the appreciation i need.

i want friends who can love my intelligence, and love the high grades i get.

i get high grades, but no one even notices them.

i see someone else with a lower grade than me and everyone rushes to them.

all this loneliness is just giving me depression and low self esteem.

i shouldnt deserve this. i shouldnt deserve to feel like garbage when im not.",autisicautist,Intelligence

Security Clearance Question,"Greetings,
I'm a first year afrotc cadet and Ive had an important question on my mind that's pretty important for my future. I'm confused which is the best route to getting into a three letter agency like NGA, ONI, CIA. I'm stuck between continuing AFROTC and pursing that career further down the line. On the flip side of things I've heard from some people that doing Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve to get a security clearance is also a fair idea. I was thinking perhaps with an internship at one of these places or somewhere similar could get me in the door quicker out of college? (Just needed some clear info because talking to my Captain or either the Reserve/Guard are all biased)

A Quick Analysis on the Possible Identity of the Exfiltrated Asset in Today's News Coverage,"The conclusion that the Oleg Smolenkov *listed online* as living in VA is the CIA asset appearing in many news publications today appears to be highly unlikely. See a quick analysis below (based on free available documents online). 

According to the VA Stafford property accessor, an [Oleg and *Antonina* Smolenkov](https://imgur.com/a/jzU5KTE) live in a house about an hour south of Washington DC. There are two important things to note here. 

First, it is highly unlikely that the agency’s defector resettlement center would 1) allow a still classified ex-asset to purchase a home under their given name that could easily be found online and 2) not have provided the asset with a new legal identity to do so. 

Second, the State Dept.'s Office of the Chief of Protocol publishes historical lists of registered foreign diplomats working in the US. These lists also include the **names of diplomats' spouses**. Two historical lists that I was able to find from the years that Smolenkov, who worked for then Amb. Yuri Ushakov, was in DC list Smolenkov's [wife as Regina Smolenkova](https://imgur.com/a/dxIdtYC). Here is a second [source](https://imgur.com/a/jX2txYo). 

So we know an Oleg Borisovich Smolenkov worked for Yuri Ushakov as a chief adviser in the office of Ushakov and previously as a second secretary for Ushakov when he was Ambassador to the United States. We also know prior to this, Smolenkov held various positions in the monetary and financial department and in the office of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Also, according to Russian media outlets reporting on information taken from a telegram channel, this Oleg Smolenkov took his wife and three children on vacation to Montenegro in July of 2017, whereupon they vanished (the police had been investigating their disappearance as possible murder).

However, for the Oleg Smolenkov living in northern Viriginia to be the same speculated about in today's news, it would require that 1) he remarried between 2010 and 2018 (which is not necessarily unlikely), 2) a confirmation that the patronymic of the Smolenkov living in VA is Borisovich, and 3) that the CIA's defector resettlement center failed to fulfill the most basic requirements of their job. 

EDIT: Here are some more tidbits I found (unrelated to my point): 
 
-Two [violations appeared](https://imgur.com/a/cYNOnTP) when Oleg Borisovich Smolenkov is searched for in Virginia Court Records. The dates are consistent with the dates of his employment in DC. 

-A [document](https://imgur.com/a/PhBHcwS) that shows Oleg Borisovich Smolenkov was recognized by the State Dept. beginning on Oct. 6, 2006.",swedishcuisinesucks,Intelligence

"Mitrokhin ""archive"": Reliable or Disinformation?","[https://imgur.com/a/BYG16gc](https://imgur.com/a/BYG16gc)

Less than a week ago, I watched the Hindi movie 'The Tashkent Files'.  This film is supposedly about the mystery surrounding the death of the  second Prime Minister of India, Shri. Lal Bahadur Shastri.In my opinion, it's an extremely bad movie for a multitude of reasons. The  editing, screenplay and the story could have been far better. As far as the research goes, the movie does get a few things right - like the cuts on Shastri ji's body, the body had turned blue / black indicating that  he was probably poisoned, no autopsy / post-mortem examination was  performed, the suspicious timings of the deaths of Dr. Chug and cook  Ramnath, etc. It doesn't take a great researcher to uncover this  information as one can find all these facts, and more, by a simple  Google search. But, on the other hand, it does take significant effort  and research to speculate what forces could have been behind the alleged  murder of Shastri ji. And this is where the movie is so deplorable.  Vivek Agnihotri, the director-producer-screenwriter of the movie, got the historical context so wrong that the movie ended up being nothing  more than propaganda.

The movie begins with the defection of a  Russian ex-intelligence official named Vasili Mitrokhin. Since the  thesis of the movie relies heavily on Mitrokhin and his ""archive"" /  papers, it's important to understand his background. Mitrokhin joined  the MGB (as the KGB was known till 1953), the intelligence agency of  Soviet Russia, in 1948 as a foreign intelligence officer. Following his  unsatisfactory performance, he was downgraded and posted to the Archives  department of the KGB. This department housed all the closed files of  previous foreign intelligence operations. Starting in the year 1972, he  started to copy the contents of important classified documents by hand  on pieces of paper, take them to his house, type them at night and hide  it under the floor. He did this for a period of 12 years by which time  he had typed nearly 25,000 pages of classified information. He retired  from the KGB in 1985. In 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union  aka USSR, he took his copied documents and defected to the United  Kingdom. A few years later, he co-authored a book titled 'The Sword and  the Shield' with Christopher Andrew, a British intelligence historian,  based on his copied documents. Following the death of Mitrokhin in 2004,  Andrew wrote another book titled 'The World Was Going Our Way' which,  among other things, details the secret operations of the KGB in India.  \[Also published under the title 'The KGB and the World: The Mitrokhin  Archive II'\]

In short, this is the story of Mitrokhin and his  ""archive"". Or should I say, this is what we have been told. The movie  not only begins with Mitrokhin's story but also the 8-10min monologue  towards the end of the movie and the title cards are based entirely on  Mitrokhin's ""archive"".

So what's the problem with the movie?  Why do I call it propaganda? Well, the movie makes sweeping remarks  based on the questionable Mitrokhin archives or worse, based on nothing  at all. The movie insinuates that Soviet Russia killed Shastri ji so  that India could be transformed into a socialist country !! Here's the  relevant dialogue from the movie: *""Let's talk about motives now. Shastri  ji ke death ke 10 saalon ke andar India ko phir se colonize kiya gaya.  Yes, India became a colony again*"". And what's the basis for this claim?  The 42nd amendment to the Constitution of India passed in 1976 which  amended the Preamble and changed the description of India from  ""sovereign democratic republic"" to a ""sovereign, socialist secular  democratic republic"". The movie's claims are ridiculous for three  reasons:

**i.** If Russia's motive to kill Shastri ji in 1966 was  to make India a socialist state, then why did they wait for 10 more  years to force India to add the word 'socialist' to the Constitution?!!

**ii.** The movie does not explicitly mention Indira Gandhi but hints that  she was controlled by the KGB and thus her govt added the word  'socialist' to the Constitution. And since most of the opposition  leaders and intellectuals were in jail during the emergency period, she  could get the amendment passed. Well, if that's the case, one needs to  answer a very simple question: Indira Gandhi lost the 1977 general  elections and was no longer the PM. Morarji Desai was the new PM. Why  did he not remove the word 'socialist' from the Constitution? Was he  controlled by Russia too?!! And guess what? The word 'socialist' is  present in the Constitution even today !!! So does this mean that all  PMs from 1976 are controlled by Russia? Since the Pradhan Sewak hasn't  removed the word 'socialist' from the Constitution, will Agnihotri call  Modi a Russian puppet too??!!

**iii.** There's absolutely NO  LOGICAL REASON to leap forward 10 years after the alleged murder and  cite an event as the ""clue"" to solving Shastri ji's alleged murder. I  wonder how he made the jump to 1976 !! Going by this logic, one can also  say that the ""economic reforms"" of 1991 (Globalization, Liberalization)  to make India a ""capitalist"" economy is proof of CIA's complicity in  Shastri ji's murder !!! After all, if Russia can wait for 10 years, then  the US can wait for 25 years too !! This is the kind of absurd and  shallow research done by Vivek Agnihotri and his team.

Towards  the end of the movie, the protagonist, Ragini Phule, displays the book  'The KGB and the World: The Mitrokhin Archive II' and says *""Jab 1992 me  USSR toota, uske baad Mitrokhin ne 25,000 KGB ke secret documents  Britain ko diya. Uske baad Britain me aur Italy me Mitrokhin Commission  bithaya gaya jiske baad jitne corrupt politicians the, leaders the unke  against cases chale""*. Let us now look at the story of Mitrokhin and his  ""archives"" with a critical eye.

If one believes Mitrokhin's  story about how he copied the contents of classified documents, then one  would have to believe that he was able to copy the secret documents  starting from 1972 until his retirement in 1985 without ever even being  suspected. Mitrokhin explains that he made notes on pieces of paper,  stuffed them into his shoes, typed it at his home and hid it under the  floor. He then defected to the UK in 1992. During this time i.e 20 years  when he had all this secret information, he claims that he did not  contact any foreign intelligence agency. In other words, he had all this  information but chose to do nothing with it !! Instead, he chose to  hide these notes in his own house, which if discovered, would have meant  the death sentence. Hiding incriminating evidence in his own house for  20 full years is beyond stupid; something that you wouldn't expect from  someone working in an intelligence agency like the KGB. After all,  Mitrokhin makes the case that the KGB was a very efficient and ruthless  spy agency which successfully infiltrated the govts of many countries  and spied on them. Would such an efficient agency be so sloppy so as to  miss what's happening under their noses for 20 years? It would have been  a different story if Mitrokhin was able to smuggle out secret  information once or twice. But to get away with it for 13 years  (1972-1985) is something that is very hard to believe.

There  are other problems with his story. B. Raman, a founder member of India's  external intelligence agency Research &amp; Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW)  and a former head of the Counter Terrorism division, too had a hard time  believing Mitrokhin's story. Here's what he had to say about it:""Mitrokhin served in the operational division of the Foreign  Intelligence Directorate of the KGB till 1956. He was then removed from  the operational division because of his unsatisfactory performance and  posted in the Archives in which he continued to function till his  retirement in 1985 -- that is, for a total of 29 years. During this  period, he was not posted abroad again. Nor was he sent out on foreign  travel. This speaks of his poor professional reputation in the  organization. Would a man considered incompetent and untrustworthy for  operational work be put in a job where every day he would have access to  hundreds of sensitive operational files? Unlikely.

A rule of  caution generally followed by intelligence agencies is that they send  only the non-actionable files of the administrative and analysis  branches to the Archives or the Record Room. Operational files are not  sent to the Archives, even after an operation is closed. They remain in  the custody of the operational branch concerned...... All intelligence  agencies more or less follow the same rules of security in order to  safeguard the identities of their sources and the modus operandi of the  operation. Moreover, no one, however trustworthy, is allowed to work  alone in a branch containing operational files. Generally, there has to  be at least two persons present to prevent the possibility of one person  taking advantage of his being alone for photocopying or photographing  files.

If Mitrokhin's story is to be believed, none of these  security precautions were followed in the KGB. The operational files of  branches dealing with dozens of countries were allowed to be kept in one  place in the central Archives, the personal particulars and details of  the modus operandi were kept in the files, and Mitrokhin was able to  work alone day after day, hour after hour -- undisturbed -- taking down  notes from the files and taking the notes out in the evening. According  to him, it took 12 years for all the files to be transferred from one  building to another, thereby giving him adequate time to go through many  of them and take down notes. One finds it very difficult to believe all  this.""

Amy Knight, an American historian who has been called  'The West's foremost scholar of the KGB', commented - ""Did not the KGB  have some sort of time-accounting or performance reports as all  bureaucracies do? The sheer volume of the materials Mitrokhin is said to  have copied by hand (tens of thousands of documents) makes one wonder  how he could have found the time"". She further adds - ""Incredibly, given  the rigorous security rules in all Soviet archives, no one noticed what  Mitrokhin was doing all day or checked him when he was going home at  night"". Needless to say, Mitrokhin's story doesn't seem to be credible  at all.

It's also important to look at the historical context:  Following the defeat of the Axis powers (Nazis = Hitler, and the  Japanese) in World War II, USA and Soviet Russia fought what came to be  known as the Cold War. The US, British and their Western European allies  (NATO) were engaged in intelligence operations and proxy war against  Soviet Russia and its Eastern European allies. Ever since the late  1940s, the Brits and the Russians were fighting on OPPOSITE sides.

With this important background information, let us now re-examine the  dialog bit by bit. As you are about to see, there are multiple mistakes  in just this one dialog !!

**i.** *""Jab 1992 me USSR toota""*. **WRONG**. USSR ceased to exist on 26 Dec 1991; not 1992.

**ii.** *""uske baad Mitrokhin ne 25,000 KGB ke secret documents Britain ko  diya""*. **WRONG AGAIN**. Mitrokhin did not hand over ANY secret documents to  Britain; nor did he make photocopies of the original documents. He  handed over the notes that he made; not the documents. There is a big  difference between the two. Had Mitrokhin photocopied the original  documents and then handed those over to the Brits, then it's credibility  would have been much higher. But in spite of being surrounded by  photocopiers in his office, Mitrokhin decided to make handwritten copies  of the documents for 12 years !!! So now, one has to take his word for  it. And one has to assume that he copied all the documents faithfully  without committing any intentional or unintentional mistakes.

**iii.** *""Uske baad Britain me aur Italy me Mitrokhin Commission bithaya  gaya jiske baad jitne corrupt politicians the, leaders the unke against  cases chale""* \[In fact, at an earlier point in the movie, one can find a  very similar dialog - *""Mitrokhin archives world ki sabse best  counter-intelligence report hai. Uski wajah se Britain aur Italy me  tamaam cases chale. Agar Indians Mitrokhin archives padh le na, to civil  war hojayega""*\]

This kind of dialog-writing is sooo blatantly dishonest. This is what is known as ""selective reporting"".

**FACT:** Mitrokhin Commission was set up in Italy; not in Britain.  Following the uproar caused by the allegations in Mitrokhin's book 'The  Sword and the Shield', a parliamentary commission was set up in 2002 to  investigate the claims that some Italian politicians were KGB agents and  on KGB's payroll. What the movie DOES NOT tell you is that even after  FOUR YEARS of investigation the commission found no concrete evidence to  support Mitrokhin's allegations and thus it was eventually disbanded in  2006 !! Not even one political figure was exposed !! But this dialog  makes it seem as if the alleged KGB agents were punished. Can such a  director be relied upon to find the truth about Shastri ji's death?

The story gets even more interesting: The Mitrokhin Commission was  presided by Senator Paolo Guzzanti. Apart from the Mitrokhin archives,  the commission relied on various other sources including a consultant  named Mario Scaramella. In late 2006, the consultant Scaramella was  arrested and charged with libel (defamation) after the wiretaps of phone  calls between him and Senator Paolo Guzzanti were published by the  Italian press, showing that the two planned to discredit various  political opposition figures by claiming that they were KGB agents. In  other words, not a single person named in the Mitrokhin archives was  sent to jail but the guy who tried to put them in jail eventually landed  up there himself !! And in 2006, a new commission was setup to  investigate the Mitrokhin Commission for allegations that it was  manipulated for political purposes. So the hunters became the hunted !!  Hahahaha !! But Vivek Agnihotri saw it fit to hide these facts !!

What happened in Britain is also very fascinating. As B. Raman, founder  member of R&amp;AW, notes: ""It is significant that MI-6 and MI-5, the  internal Security Service, did not prosecute any of the persons named by  Mitrokhin as KGB agents. They did not even consider it necessary to  interview or question them in order to get their comments on the  allegations leveled against them by Mitrokhin. Instead, MI-5 and MI-6  proposed in 1996 that the notes brought by Mitrokhin should be given to  Professor Christopher Andrew for joint publication with Mitrokhin after  suitable editing"".

Let me explain: The British intelligence  services and the British govt chose NOT to prosecute anyone named in the  Mitrokhin archives in a court of law. Instead they chose Chistopher  Andrew, the official historian of the MI5, to co-author a book. Why?  Since Mitrokhin's archive comprises of his notes and did not include any  official document or photocopy, it cannot be considered as evidence in a  court of law. This fact alone shows that the MI6 themselves did not  consider the Mitrokhin archives credible enough to prosecute or even  question the alleged KGB agents. But they used the material as a  propaganda tool against their old enemy Russia. This is what is known as  PSYWAR. Classic techniques of the Cold War era.

So, to trust  the Mitrokhin archives requires one to also place immense faith in the  British intelligence agencies i.e. MI-5 and MI-6. Taking their word at  face value would be as silly and ridiculous as trusting the word of  Pakistan that India engages in cross-border terrorism in Pakistan !! Of  course the Brits are going to publish material which will show the  Russians in a bad light. What else do you expect?!! Christopher Andrew,  the co-author of Mitrokhin's books, enrolled into the Security Service  (MI-5) in 2003 !! And the book 'The KGB and the World: The Mitrokhin  Archive II', which talks about KGB agents in India, was published in the  year 2005. In other words, somebody who gets paid by the British MI-5  has been charged with telling the truth about their enemy (Russia) to a  country which they had previously colonized (India) !! Hmm....that  sounds very credible indeed !!!! And did I mention that the original  handwritten notes by Vasili Mitrokhin haven't yet been declassified by  the Brits? But that's okay. The Brits wouldn't lie. They have NEVER lied  !!! Let's believe whatever they publish !! Will somebody please explain  the concept of 'Conflict of Interest' to this idiot film-maker?

Further, the protagonist Ragini Phule states - ""Mitrokhin ke report ko  world ka best counter-intelligence report mana jata hai lekin India  me.....ushhhh !!! Daba do, sab daba do"". World ka best  counter-intelligence report? Hahaha. Well, here's another interesting  fact. Before defecting to the United Kingdom, Mitrokhin approached the  CIA with his archives and sought asylum in America. He told a story so  fanciful that the CIA officers considered it to be an entirely  fraudulent effort. His documents were examined and the CIA rejected them  !! In other words, the KGB's fiercest rival, the CIA, which was always  looking for new ways to discredit the Russians and paint them as evil,  did not buy what Mitrokhin was selling !! It shows that the CIA did not  believe Mitrokhin's story at all. Neither did the founder member of  Indian intelligence agency R&amp;AW, B. Raman. But Vivek Agnihotri calls  this report ""the world's best counter-intelligence report"" !!! In fact,  this line is repeated twice in the movie.

The movie also  doesn't explain why the Russians had chosen to kill Shastri ji in the  Soviet Union i.e. on their own land? Would any country / intelligence  agency want to kill a foreign leader on their soil and be blamed for it?  The movie states that *""KGB ke pure duniya me jitne spies the, usme  sabse jyada spies India me the""*. If that was the case, then why didn't  they kill Shastri ji in India?  As I said, the movie doesn't even  attempt to answer this fundamental question.

In my opinion,  the CIA is a good suspect for Shastri ji's alleged murder. I say this  because the CIA has a long history of overthrowing democratically  elected govts and replacing them with puppet govts or dictators,  indulging in proxy war, political assassinations, false flag operations,  terror atttacks and more. For eg. The CIA overthrew Prime Minister  Mohammed Mossadegh of Iran in 1953, President Jacobo Arbenz of Gautemala  in 1954, Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba of Congo in 1961, President  Salvador Allende of Chile in 1973, and so many others. Seen from the  CIA's perspective, it would make perfect sense to kill Shastri ji in  Soviet Union and thus attempt to drive a wedge between India and Russia.  This would help to get India away from Soviet Russia and into the  western orbit in the cold war. If the Americans ever wanted to kill  Shastri ji, Tashkent would be the perfect place. I'd like to make it  explicitly clear that this is just speculation. However, in the movie,  the CIA comes up only once. And guess what? It shouldn't be hard to  guess !!! The movie gives a clean chit to the CIA in the Shastri ji case  !!! This line says it all - *""Tum log kya samajhte ho? Sare  assassinations CIA hi karwata hai? Aur bhi agencies hai""* !!!

With so many mistakes / lies in the movie, one has to ask the question -  Are these genuine mistakes? Or did the director know about it and still  go ahead with it?Well, at the very end of the movie, a few  title cards show more allegations from the Mitrokhin archives; for eg.  Indira Gandhi received millions from the KGB. And then comes the punch  line - *""The authenticity of the claims made in this report is not  proven""* !!! Lol !! After basing his entire conclusion and conspiracy  theory on the questionable and controversial Mitrokhin archives, the  director acknowledges that these claims haven't been proven. This proves  that the director knew that the claims were not substantiated but that  didn't stop him from using it in his movie. This is so because as a  director, Vivek Agnihotri knows that it's the visuals and dialogs of the  movie that matter, not the disclaimer / title cards. And so, he went  ahead with his despicable propaganda.

In my opinion, this  article proves that this movie was NOT so much a movie on Shastri ji's  alleged murder but rather a Russia-bashing conspiracy theory. It appears  that this was the real intention behind making this movie while Shastri  ji's death was reduced to a subplot.

The timing of the  release of this movie is also very interesting. The movie was released  on 12 April 2019. If you recall, the elections began on the previous day  i.e. on the 11th. Is it just a co-incidence that the movie portrays the  leadership of the Congress party as a slave of the Russians on the eve  of the general elections? Not likely.

Vivek Agnihotri is a  failed director and film maker. He had only made 5 movies in the last 15  years prior to the current one. In fact, he acknowledges this fact  himself. He said - *""I had no work. Nobody in bollywood was giving me any  work""* !! He goes on to say - *""This film I think should be looked at as a  R&amp;D film of film-making""* !!! Actually, this film should be looked  at as an R&amp;D film of propaganda and psywar. Of late, he has found  some fame by targeting leftists, giving lip service to Hindu causes and  taking on radical Muslims in TV debates. His refusal to include more  info about the CIA in the movie coupled with the blatant lies against  the Russians could be a hint of things to come in the future. In my  opinion, he will take an openly pro-Hindu posture and continue to  actively cover-up the bloody history of the American empire and the CIA.  And almost all Hindus won't notice his deliberate lies because sadly,  the moment a prominent individual takes a pro-Hindu stance, most Hindus  go nuts and all logic, research, analysis jumps out of the window.  Gullible Hindus support that individual to the extreme at the cost of  facts. A very bad trend for the future of India.

As far as  Indian politicians are concerned, there's one politician who always  mentions and quotes from the Mitrokhin's archive. It's none other than Subramanian Swamy  !! Just the guy you would expect to do such a sort of thing.

This dialog from 'The Tashkent Files' aptly describes the director Vivek  Agnihotri - *""I'm done with this ethical shit... Kisko chahiye facts?  Yahaan sab chalta hai""* !! This line should have been the subtitle of the  movie !!!

Please share this article among your friends and  relatives. And help to expose this sick propaganda hit-piece  masquerading as a movie. As a character in the movie says - *""Idiots hai  woh jinko sach se darr lagta hai. Darna rumours se chahiye, kyunki agar  rumour ko roka na jaaye toh woh aisa sach ban jaati hai jiske saamne  sach bhi jhooth lagne lagta hai""*.

Nightwatch is no more :( Does anyone have a solid alternative nightly intelligence newsletter?,"For those that don't know, [Nightwatch](https://www.ezsubscription.com/nnl/about.html) was the pet project of John McCreary who wrote it since 1993 when he was at DIA, and then continued to work on it via open sources after his ""retirement"". He passed away a couple weeks ago.

It was a fantastic executive summary of the night's geopolitical news - very disciplined, and very structured. I subscribed to it for many years even after he started charging to continue its operation a few years ago.

Does anyone know of a good alternative that isn't full of mainstream media conjecture and lack of editorial discipline?

For the curious, here's JFM's bio below:

&gt; John McCreary is the Owner and chief editor of NightWatch, LLC.  Mr. McCreary has over 50 years of experience as a professional analyst and is a distinguished and decorated 40-year veteran of defense and air force intelligence. He is the author of the internationally acclaimed threat newsletter NightWatch.
&gt; 
&gt; Prior to forming NightWatch, LLC, he served for nine years as the Chief Analysis Officer of Kforce Government Solutions (KGS.)  Prior to that he was the Highly Qualified Expert (HQE) for analysis transformation with the United States Air Force where he taught and mentored the analysts of the Air Force Intelligence Analysis Agency, wrote and taught the first course in advanced intelligence analysis for the Air Force and installed an end-to-end, systematic analysis evaluation and feedback program for the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. McCreary joined the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1968 as an intelligence research specialist, specializing in Chinese language and studies. Between 1980 and 1992 he was the senior analyst and Director, National Warning Staff, Office of the Director of Central Intelligence. In 1992 he served as the lead attorney-investigator for the Senate Select Committee for POW/MIA affairs.
&gt; 
&gt; From 1993 until his retirement from DIA in 2006, he was the senior analyst in the Directorate of Intelligence, J2, Joint Staff in the Pentagon. He was promoted to senior rank in the first class of Defense Intelligence Senior Level Experts in DIA. At the time of his departure from DIA in 2006, he was the senior ranking Defense Intelligence Senior Level Expert in the agency and in the Joint Staff in the Pentagon.
&gt; 
&gt; He has received dozens of commendations, citations, medals and awards from the Intelligence Community, the CIA and the DIA.  In 2004 he received a Presidential Rank Award for Meritorious Service; the only DIA analyst to have received this award.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. McCreary is a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Illinois, class of 1968, and a graduate of Georgetown Law Center. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi and the Virginia State Bar.
&gt; 
&gt; He has been the principal author of NightWatch since its inception in 1993, first as a highly classified daily threat summary for senior executives in the Department of Defense. In retirement after 2006, at the request of flag rank officers in the Defense Department, he converted NightWatch to an exclusively open source threat document, which it remains through this date.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to NightWatch, his other publications include, The Latest Intelligence Crisis, with US Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Posner, in Intelligence and National Security, Volume 23, Issue 3, 2008; Intelligence as Evidence, J2 monograph,1996; Analysis of Political Instability, J2 monograph, 1995; Warning Cycles, Studies in Intelligence, 1983.",steezy13312,Intelligence

"[Podcast] Jeffrey Epstein-focused deep dive into the history of blackmail networks, mafia and intelligence cooperation in the United States","Hello everyone, I thought you fine people would enjoy this episode of our podcast that presents a narrative stretching back to the beginning of the 20th Century that explains the Epstein case in terms of it's relationship to mafia-intelligence deep state and a blackmail network that uses, amongst other things, pedophilia, sex slavery and human trafficking to control people of influence in the government and elite social circles of our society. Our goal here was to produce something that would help people make sense of the Epstein news in context, instead of as sensational news items that can be spun for partisan political purposes.

""...I was eventually offered a place in the syndicate. The syndicate was presented to me as a kind of fraternity, a masonic-like mutual profit organization with strong police-like overtones. I was told that I was helping to build a better society. However, I have never been given any of the advancement opportunities I was promised. The ""advancement system"" of the syndicate is a slippery slope. They make you give up your security privileges, so eventually all of your communications are watched (which is why I composed this email offline where they cannot see me, and sent it via an internet cafe), and you have to attend meeting after meeting of mind-numbing pledges and chants.

The premise is that if you sign contracts giving up personal liberties for the group, and you are genuinely innocent, then you will be promoted. I have only been promoted once, to the rank of manager, and I don't feel as if it is a rewarding experience. Worse, you are never allowed to leave because they think you will give away secrets. Leaving is only permissible with a special contract that permits the syndicate to destroy your credibility (usually they make sure that the most attention any secrets that you reveal get is from crackpot UFO magazines, or diagnose you with schizophrenia).

There are other problems. If you have children, you have to send them to education in syndicate owned schools. If you have a wife, you have to report on her, allow her to be spied upon, and be prepared to target her if they decide to turn her into a TI (Targeted Individual). The official ""compensation"" policy is that you will get to keep the children if she lodges a divorce. However, you won't get to keep most of her material goods. They only want her to lose in the divorce proceedings so she gets nothing, not so the husband gets anything, so the syndicate takes it back as a tithe.

I suppose I should introduce the syndicate in a little more detail. I'm still not sure precisely what it is trying to do. To everyday citizens, it presents itself as a group trying to monitor terrorists (or any other kind of flavour-of-the-month undesirables like gays/communists/witches) and drive them out. To other people, it is a rotary club/chamber of commerce type operation. To others still, the most twisted conspiratorial minds, it is an organization that pulls the strings behind everything. To the puritan, it is a cleansing force. To the deviant, it is a gang of other deviants where everything is permissible. It is the syndicate to everyone, though. I don't know the extent of what it owns.

I do, however, know a great deal about the targeting process. When we get targets, we divide them into four categories: mercenary, practice, planning, and enemy. Mercenary targets are bought by outside parties. We advertise under a range of guises, from ads by ""individuals"" claiming to be able to kidnap people, to practical jokers. Some groups, like big corporations and some governments (the government of Xxxxxx pays us to keep some people busy, so do the Xxxxxxs when they have too many people protesting whaling) know fully well what sort of services we do, so we don't really hide them. We get a lot of money from them, but we can still muster up a fair bit if worse comes to worst.

I'm not sure so much about the NWO theory. Maybe the Xxxxxxx count, but you'd be surprised at how much money we can get from crime. I don't mean that we go out robbing people, but we can outsource money from biker gangs/skinheads/drug dealers pretty easily.

Our syndicate gets a lot of support from people in rough areas like Xxxxxx and Xxxx's Xxxx. Because there are areas with a lot of people in genuine need, who would leap at the thought of fighting back at the criminals, we can always find allies to pressure the criminal portions of society. Of course, they are only pressuring them into giving us money, but it is a pretty cozy arrangement.

The second type of target is the practice target. We use them to train mobs. The targets do not actually change, because we do not want TOO many people fighting back at us. But we do rotate trainees between practice targets. This stops the person seeing the same people every time there is a street show.

Then there are planning targets. These are selected by the syndicate for some reason or other but are not paid for by mercenaries. You can usually tell the difference between planning and practice targets because they send people with experience after them. They are still chosen by the same people, though. The practice ones are, of course, chosen for their timidity. I do not know how the planning ones are chosen.

Enemy targets are people that decide they have had enough and turn against us. Since they protest and try to foil our plans (which, considering that our jobs are already nervy, is a real pain in the arse), we try to really give them hell.

The best way, of course, is through the psychs. My supervisor used to say that the Soviets had it right with Sluggishly Progressing Schizophrenia. Some people up-top are proposing that we just kill them and have them declared Natural Causes or Accidental by the coroner. It is not likely to happen, though.

Anyway, I should introduce the main branches of the syndicate. Each branch recruits its own (everybody is a member of one of the branches) instead of people just joining a common pool. This keeps the work separate and stops people from finding stuff out that they should not.

My branch is the Scripting, Observation, and Execution Bureau (or ""The Theatre"" as it is popularly known). By execution, I mean the execution of orders, not the other kind. We do the work that the majority of people with any knowledge of gang stalking will be familiar with: pestering and scripting minor incidents. The Theatre is actually divided into two sub-branches: Scripting Orchestration Officers (or ""playwrights"" as they call themselves) and Field Officers (or ""thespians"" as we call ourselves). We have the most variety in our recruits. Popular sources are the police, the fire department, the zoo, and technicians of any kind. But we recruit from all places. Most members are neighborhood watch types (not official Neighborhood Watch, but ""concerned people""). Ironically, we make sure that we do a lot of good, just to get some credibility.

Then there is the Bureau of Authority (""The Moneybags""). They don't actually control the syndicate, but they have all the right jobs and connections. So, a judge might have control over the judicial process, but he will answer to a superior in the syndicate. Psychiatrists belong here too.

The Moneybags are so-called because they raise a lot of the money. It would be suspicious if big corporations funded groups like this, but they can invest money into front-groups. And the majority of the syndicate's work is done through completely legitimate fronts. We can tap phone lines and access people's records from behind government agencies. Usually, these are the guys that go after Enemy Targets. Normally, harrassment is organized under several ""action policies."" If a target is not an enemy, a standard policy is enforced. Low level organizers (the aforementioned ""playwrights"") play around with the target for a while and rotate crews.

When a target is an ""enemy,"" the policy does not immediately change, but orders filter down from high-level organizers (usually the Supreme Council) which direct 'Thespians' to provoke the target or a similar action, and Moneybags to crack down on them once they get in the way of the system. This is called Mincing, because the thespians lure the ""meat"" (by making it complain or fight back) into the ""mincer.""

The Bureau also protects members of the syndicate. Normally, in a court case/psych examination or similar situation where a syndicate member is at the mercy of a moneybag, a special order arrives from above telling the moneybag to take it easy on the guy and let him off scott free. The order is always printed in blue, on fancy cherry-blossom paper, but in a very official border/font. ""Cherrying"" is the name for this secret process. The Bureau of Authority has a very organized system of lawyers, judges, medical officers, etc. Whenever you are committing a crime for the good of the syndicate, you must always report your location. Then they send Cousin Nancy (this is an affectionate term for the police in the employment of the syndicate that they send to arrest you instead of non-syndicate cops, so you can go straight through the appropriate channels without anything suspicious being seen) to tail you and ""arrest"" you the moment somebody calls 911.

They all follow a minimalist strategy though. For example, the mayor of Xxxxx isn't a member of the syndicate. But several of his advisors and aides are. This way we can get laws passed in a discreet manner, and if a high-profile figure is targeted, our hold on an organization does not loosen. We try to arrange elections of mayors that are not too headstrong. Though the government is mainly used as a minor nuisance, we prefer the courts for most activities.

The Bureau of Technology (Field), BoT(F) is the group in charge of the electrical equipment. They work alongside us thespians and ""gaffer"" the targets by giving them the usual fatigue/headaches/medical problems. They can also destroy equipment, screw up televisions, the works. I think they are particularly sadistic.

Different crews use different Techs, but they are all unpleasant. The incapacitators come in a lot of different forms. There are ones that come as a light bulb that slowly gives people eye-strain and makes them tired. You can fit some in computer/TV monitors and the glare irritates people. I have heard they are even building fridge magnets with electronic devices in them. That is not the extent of the BoT(F)'s machinery. [Because people are not aware it allows those engaged in inflicting the harm to be reckless of any short, long, or lethal effects inflicted on their victims. These things touch on what is available in society, although the sophistication can not be under estimated. The sophistication, and their technologies in general, may become recognizable when it is known that it exits, and how affected their victims are. This by no means is typified by something as simple as lights, flashlight size, that change color too fast for the eyes to pick up causing intracranial pressure causing headaches, to nausea, such as LED Incapacitators. Using this type of technology oversimplifies, but demonstrates the peril that citizens at large, or anybody, is in that is not aware. Before, or when you first become aware"" how out there"" these technologies seem. This is why they spend so much time and energy keeping it below the awareness thresholds of those who would scrutinize their behavior and what they are engaged in, as well as society in general. This site attempts to convey how common it is, the mechanisms they have in place, as well as building an awareness foundation of the technologies. This awareness foundation can be used not only to grasp things that would have gone undetected, but as importantly enable someone to continue to build on this foundation. Including networking through those of us who are attempting to get the foundation information through the awareness barrier they have in place.]

They manufacture pills that can cause deformities in the womb, as well as miscarriage and give them to women in their food. They can fake HIV/AIDS so the test shows up positive the first time, but subsequent tests show that it was a false positive. This faux-HIV can be put in the target's food. They usually give the target a few health scares, but they do not like to physically hurt anyone. One Field Tech I knew had a penchant for giving people Syphilis. They could treat it easily enough with penicillin (and the syndicate always made sure that it would be diagnosed on time), but it showed up on the targets' permanent records for medical treatment. They also conduct extensive testing without the target's knowledge.

One TI (targeted individual) we were monitoring was found to have a malignant tumor (not our doing) [they cause many types of cancers and tumors due to how we are affected on a cellular level]. He wasn't experiencing any of the symptoms, so we gave him some through the incapacitators and had a few of his friends warn him about cancer. He had a test done, and just for fun, we had the doctor tell him how dangerous it could be and how he could die soon. We gave him a six month waiting period and told him that by then the tumor could progress so far that it could never be removed. That's a lie, of course. Our BoT(F) had it out in a jiffy by sending one of their brain surgeons to do the job, but it is the fear that counts.

The Bureau of Technology (Communications) monitors the target's phone calls, emails, and absolutely everything else. They tend to recruit from the national archives, census takers office, records office, credit card companies, medicare, insurance, etc. They are the logistics branch. As I said, most of the syndicate's work is done from within legitimate areas.

What the BoT(C) does (very often) is send a ""receptionist applicant"" over to a credit card company or government agency pretending she knows nothing about hacking computers or accessing records. We pull a few strings and she is in. She then steals information while nobody is looking. A few old-timers like to have 100 per cent control over the ""records farm"" but most prefer the minimalist approach.

This is the bureau that gives out information and orders to everybody else, and also acts as a communications post for the whole syndicate.

The Supreme Council delivers orders through them. Outside orders are also taken in through the BoT(C), which advertises as a mercenary group through certain channels.

The Bureau of Alliances, or ""trading partners"" handles our allies. As far as I know, the syndicate is Xxxxxxan only. The only other gang stalking group in this country is a West Xxxxxxxxan organization called the confederacy. Very often they try to move into the xxxxx xxxxx so we have to hold them back, diplomatically or otherwise. However, we have contracts with Xxxxxxan groups whereby we handle their targets when they move into Xxxxxx. The same with the Xxxxan groups and the confederacy. The other groups pay for their targets to be ""handled"" while they travel here. We make millions of dollars this way.

Finally, the Supreme Council controls the entire operation. I have no idea who they are, except that they have a fancy name instead of being a Bureau. They do not recruit their own men. They promote from the other departments. Most of them seem to be wealthy individuals with inheritances that manage to maintain their fortunes from investments. Not one is a CEO, Judge, or Politician. They are all just old money family types that live in the Xxxxxx Xxxxx and seem unusually lucky with their money (no doubt through insider trading).

Despite this, they have a lot of spiffy technology. They have a kind of reverse incapacitator that improves their health and increases their performance. Most of them look incredibly young for their age. We don't see them much, though. Often, an audience with one of them is a kind of reward for good service.

There are also ranks in our syndicate. The lowest members are pawns. They are not technically members, because there is no permanent service contract and they do not know they are working for us. They take orders from us but are not expected to attend meetings. We call our pawns ""concerned citizens,"" the Authority bureau has ""office boys"" or ""secretaries,"" the BoT(F) has ""lab rats"" (who very often are paid volunteers for experiments, or people who do not know what they are testing); the BoT(C) has ""spelunkers;"" the BoA has ""travel agents."" Unfortunately, we are not obligated to give protection to any of these people. So, we can give a vet an order to put down a dog, without telling him that it is not consented to by the owner, and he will do the job and get sued without us giving him legal protection.

A lot of our street theater is done by people that do not even know they are part of a syndicate. They think they are a grass roots movement and do not know that there are other people harassing the target.

The BoT(C) recruits people that think they are joining l33t hacker groups on the internet, or people that think that they are just following orders from the archives. The BoT(F) does 80 per cent of its research at legitimate agencies like Xxxxxx's XXXXX and its drug companies.

The task of pawns is to think that what they are doing is either normal and routine, or criminal in an individual isolated manner.

Recruits, however, are aware of a conspiracy. However, they still remain at a misinformed level. We simultaneously maintain teams of ""religious"" actors and ""punk"" actors. A person might join us thinking he is going to clean up the community. Another person might join us thinking he is going to cause trouble and anarchy. And they can go about their merry ways. We even deliver information to them in different ways. To the religious ones, it is wrapped up in prophecy and revelation. To the punks, it is given a communist candy coating. However, they are all aware that the group is large. They are also aware of a mutual benefit aspect to the operation. Only greedy un-idealistic people get beyond the recruit rank.

All the Bureaus wrap themselves up in different colors. The Moneybags pretend to be a secret club for the elite (and many of them are indeed quite powerful and wealthy, second only to the Supreme Council). The BoT(F) claims to be a ""humane"" research agency, or a means by which scientists can resist corporate greed, though it still attracts deviants. The BoT(C) is conspiratorially minded, and pretends to be a group searching for the 'secrets of the illuminati' or the illuminati themselves. The BoA claims to be a contract agency, traveler's club, or accounting firm.

Recruits perform tasks that they know are illegal, or immoral, but they still generally believe that they are doing it for a reason. Managers like me come above the recruits and do some actual organization, whether leading a crew to a street theater match or planning an attack. Generally, managers know everything about the syndicate except what its goal is. Most are greedy enough to accept that it is not a morally motivated group. We also engage in communication with other Bureaus to coordinate our activities.

Different terms are used for different MOs. The Theater has ""Playwrights"" and ""Leading Roles."" The moneybags have ""Success Stories."" The BoT(F) has ""Research Directors."" The BoT(C) has ""Information Awareness Officers."" The BoA has ""Arrangers."" Finally, a rare few are promoted to the Supreme Council.""

I understand that several independent laboratories have confirmed the nature of the poison used, but wouldn't providing the samples to Russia be tactically beneficial to the UK, so that they could counter-act the argument that they are hiding evidence to blame Russia? Or would the possibility of Russia denying that a Novichok agent was present in the samples be more risky than simply denying them access to the samples?",77to90,Intelligence

How to use the full potential of your intelligence,"So Im gonna try to be the most honest in this post without sounding arrogant. 
I am 18yo boy that went through somewhat depressive episode for a few years and felt like an outcast. 
I have known since I was little kid that I am more intelligent than most.
I understand difficult concepts and can really see the bigger scale of things. I hate getting into arguments because I have already understood most outcomes and possibilities. I also get amazed by work from geniuses from the arts to the scientific. 
But the things is that I highly doubt myself. I used to think I didnt know how to communicate and felt like other people were better conversionalist. I felt like people had better memory than me.
This “gift” that I have has made me insecure as ever throughout my life and during the last two years I have been working to stop feeling this way and to find fullfillment. 
I want to feel fulfilled in my relationships, in my carreer and my overall self esteem. 
 
I really want to become more confident in myself because this insecurity that I have over my looks and my social life really slows me down and I know it wastes most of my brain energy that I could use to do other things and feel challenged and interested.

People that are in the same shoes as me do you have any lessons, tips, stories to tell me.
I am tired to hear that ignorance is bliss and smart people are often depressed. 
Sorry for the long rant
Thank you",sshaman123,Intelligence

On The Right Track?,"Hey everybody,

I will try to make this brief but want to give some context first. I am 26 and have what is probably considered out of the mainstream background for my age. I've been in the insurance/finance industry as a self-employed broker since I was 18 with a family agency doing everything from sales, marketing &amp; IT work, have worked for companies like Enterprise-Rent-A-Car, in academia as VP of the Student Government Association in undergrad, and in the public sector, interning for a U.S. Senator in his district office. I also published a book at the age of 20 on autograph collecting, have flight training experience in light-sport aircraft (45hrs), and have led a non-profit with 100+ members as president in my community for three years. Education wise, I have a BA in Communications/Journalism (3.93GPA) from Texas A&amp;M locally and will get a MA in International Affairs this December from a public institution in GA (3.70GPA). I also am intermediate in Spanish and beginner in Arabic, but furthering my proficiency at an institute in Oman this Fall. I actually am picking up Arabic faster than I did Spanish!

While I do enjoy my line of work, I want to put my writing, travels/cultural expertise abroad, analytical, research and intellectual curiosity skill sets to good use as an intelligence analyst. I have gotten a CJO for a 3 letter agency as an intern in their intel program, but they could not process my background in time and I had to let it go, along with being second in line to receive an internship with NATO's intelligence production unit in Brussels. My question is does it sound like I am on the right track here with my background at having a shot at an entry level analyst for a gov agency? I know the military will be recommended but I am more focused on this line of work and worry I may not get my chosen field as an officer. Is it just being persistent with my applications that will be the difference maker? Luckily, I have a solid foundation right now and no student debt, so that is a saving grace. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated!",bribritx,Intelligence

Seth Rich and the Russian Connection,"The SVR circulated this false intelligence report to cover for the DNC hack.

This is a classic Soviet tactic, one they pioneered in Stalin's early days. [Disinformation was actually coined by the KGB.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation) Operation INFEKTION was a Soviet disinformation campaign promoting the idea that [the US was spreading AIDS.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/26/before-fake-news-there-was-soviet-disinformation/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.1fd73bdb8d06)

Back to the topic at hand. Seth Rich died in a robbery gone bad near his house. However, the SVR circulated a memo detailing salacious fictions regarding his connection to the DNC, and a possible motive for the Clinton's to have him killed. In classic fashion, the SVR reposted the same details on other websites they control, to give the illusion that the report was genuine.

[This is the original report on the disinformation surrounding Seth Rich, as reported on by most of the major news organizations. ](https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-the-true-origins-of-the-seth-rich-conspiracy-a-yahoo-news-investigation-100000831.html)

The Internet Research Agency's [involvement](https://news.yahoo.com/fire-facebook-refuses-disclose-political-ads-bought-russian-trolls-230143492.html) in the 2016 election is well-known now. The IRA pushed this conspiracy theory through all of its social media advertising and sock puppet accounts during 2016, increasing its reach.

Overall, this is a fascinating and highly successful example of a disinformation campaign to cover for an active data extraction (the emails dropped to Wikileaks). I would hazard a guess that the SVR is going to do something similar again this election cycle.",InfinityCircuit,Intelligence

Need some serious advice PLEASE!,"Thanks in advance all for any input,

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short I'm almost 28,  I took the asvab with my army recruiter for OCS and I scored high enough to branch as an intel officer.  I just need to do well in my class and hope an intel spot is open. 

I also said why not, and applied for the FBI as an SA. I have a background as a licensed financial advisor and I got the email today for the invite to take the SASS phase 1 test. Which is beyond awesome. I know its a huge acomplishment to even get invited to take the test, but the entire process takes around a year at the quickest I believe. Plus even though my work experience was very unique and right up a financial crimes type of deal, I did not go to grad school or have a 3.8 gpa. Im worried Ill get to the very end then just not make the cut cause I assume there are 300 more like myself who have their masters or better GPAs.

Well the plan was for me to go to MEPS in a few weeks and see the board right after. Then this possible FBI epic opportunity actually happened.  I underdtand its like 3% who actually end up graduating from the academy. As far as I know the oldest you can be to actually commission as an officer is 29.  See the issue?

&amp;#x200B;

I need to pick one.....   please give me some guidence.   Both would be awesome but come on, FBI is some next level stuff.  Either way I already signed up to take the SASS in two days.",Tony125s,Intelligence

A2 you have most of the grammar you need but a small vocabulary (&lt;1000 words.)

B1 would be conversational (5000 words and all the standard grammar).

B2 is often the minimum you need to immigrate to a country with that language or work in it (7-10,000 words and advanced subtle grammar.)

C1/C2 are approaching native speakers.

Chances of landing an intelligence internship next summer?,"I graduated from an Ivy League university in 2017 with a double major in international relations and geography. my studies focused on security and geospatial analysis. I held numerous GIS internships, and have worked full time as a GIS data analyst at an environmental engineering company since graduation.

I'm entering graduate school for international relations this fall at another top institution and am already considering a career in intelligence by applying for internships. So far, I've progressed in the application processes for CIA and DIA. 

I'm sure this all sounds great, but the catch is up until a year ago I was smoking weed almost every day. I live in a legal state but I know the feds don't care about that. I still clearly got my shit done, and was even the captian of my varsity athletics team in college, but I've heard the clearance process can be a pain even if you ""experimented"" with weed in college. I started my sophomore year of high school and continued for nearly seven years. 

I also tried acid, shrooms, and coke in college, but each enough to count on one hand. I got caught with weed once at the end of my freshman year but got that expunged from my record, though I’m aware the feds can still find it. Also, in high school I got a ticket for underage drinking.

I planning on disclosing all of this. Do I have a shot? Any chance they can see these as isolated to college (plus one year of smoking a lot after graduating in a legal state) and understand that I don't plan on returning to my old ways?

Global Security Risk with Fred Burton and Scott Stewart by Stratfor,"In this episode, Stratfor Security experts Fred Burton and Scott Stewart discuss the intricacies of corporate espionage risk and a recent column on security by Stewart, in which he discusses the concept that hostile actors seeking to steal critical corporate information will go wherever that information is located and use whatever tactics needed to obtain it. When a company considers its espionage risk purely on where the information is located, it can lead to security blind spots. That is why, our experts say, corporate security programs must take a global approach to identify, segregate and protect critical data in every corner of the world where it can be found.

New Espionage Thriller (Book) - Collusion,"For fans of thrillers and espionage books ala Robert Ludlum, Ben Macintyre, Daniel Silva, John le Carre, Tom Clancy, Mark Greaney, Jack Higgins...

From Goodreads:

#1 New York Times bestselling author Newt Gingrich makes his return to political fiction with this rollicking tale of high-stakes international intrigue—the first book in a new, contemporary series, filled with adventure, betrayal, and politics—that captures the tensions and divides of America and the world today. 

Valerie Mayberry is the FBI’s counterintelligence expert on domestic terrorism.

Brett Garrett is a dishonorably discharged ex-Navy SEAL, now a gun for hire, working as a security contractor in Eastern Europe.

When a high ranking Kremlin official must be smuggled out of Russia, Mayberry and Garrett are thrown together to exfiltrate him and preempt a deadly poisonous strike.

As these unlikely partners work to protect their human asset, their mission is threatened by domestic politics: leftist protests, congressional infighting, and a culture riven by hatred.

Collusion raises many of the most significant issues facing America in real life today. How big a threat is Russia? Are American leftist activists susceptible to influence from abroad? How far will our enemies go to disrupt our politics and weaken the nation? Can we trust the media to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys?

Newt Gingrich and Pete Earley have entertained and educated readers with three previous works. From its explosive opening through several twists and turns to its heart-stopping end, Collusion is their most timely and powerful novel yet.",selous_scot,Intelligence

Intelligence Careers: Early Experience and Internship Opportunities,"For those of you aspiring to enter the intelligence field, plenty of opportunities are available for working with the federal U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) component agencies. Full disclosure, the list below is meant to highlight internship opportunities for students, and/or recent graduates, and you MUST be a U.S. citizen to meet criteria for these highly selective programs. I know that searching for entry level positions for this career field while you are a student is an extremely arduous and daunting task, having gone through the process quite a few times myself. Therefore, just wanted to share some sites where you can hopefully find information on internships and positions that interest you once their application periods are actually open.

NOTE: The majority of internship applications open up during late spring, late summer, or early fall, in order to ensure adequate time passes for the security clearances so you can start employment for the following summer. Furthermore, not all internship opportunities I mention will currently be available. 

NOTE: This is all publicly available information, I've just condensed it all into one post so people have an easier time actually knowing where to look, and get used to combing through what these job applications and portals look like.

Intelligence: A Wilderness of Mirrors,"(Best viewed in old reddit with RES in night mode)

In the 15th Century, the term “intelligence” began to be used in reference to secret knowledge from spies. The processes of collection, interpretation and implementation of military and political knowledge has grown in scope, throughout human history, but many of the principles have been the same for thousands of years.

https://i.imgur.com/gAuReG9.png

While many people often think of “spies” as James Bond like figures, the truth is usually a lot more boring and slow. The most prolific spies, in this day and age, are millions of computer scripts working in the background to serve up the most important information to their masters. While military and political bodies engage in this behavior on a technologically advanced scale, the truth is that anyone can tap into this infrastructure to perform their own “intelligence” activities to stay informed, make money, keep secrets, uncover secrets, etc. 

In ancient history, leaders even considered “spiritual intelligence” from oracles, astrology and prophecy to be legitimate. It is curious to note the symbols from these groups still persist in the intelligence community, today. After a failure of this type of intelligence, the Romans admit, “trust in the gods, but verify.”

Good intelligence is a force multiplier and it is important to know the history to better understand how and why. The history of intelligence starts with battlefield intelligence through the use of scouts; where men were sent out ahead of the bulk of their forces to uncover useful information about enemy troop locations, numbers and supporting logistics. Think of “scouting” as primitive “spying.”

I recommend “The Second Oldest Profession: A World History of Espionage”: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MORgCrpZjsA9Zb4AxwzZnZIHKxgtv51S/view?usp=sharing

“The Bible” and “The Art of War” both discuss the use of spies. In Chapter 13 of the Art of War even discusses using double agents, doomed spies and other variations of spy craft. I feel this is important to point out because the news, today, is not willing to report on spying in such a way that treats these concepts as common place. Double agents have been commonplace for thousands of years. Doomed spies have been commonplace for thousands of years.

“The Art of War”: https://suntzusaid.com/

For thousands of years, while mankind’s intelligence infrastructure has grown, so has their innovation regarding spies’ ability to improve their subterfuge. From dead drops, to modified limited hang outs, to bad jacketing operations; there is a lot that the average person knows from movies and TV shows, but a lot that most people aren’t looking for, even though it is happening right in front of their faces.

“Spy Terms and Phrases” has some of these: http://archive.fo/46h5o

An extension of the ideas behind scouting was the first signals intelligence, where several torches, next to each other, could be used to communicate information across long distances. Prior using signal torches in a variety of combinations, flags, pigeons, or a series of fast runners and horses were the fastest way to communicate. Another primitive signalling technology was “heliographic” in that a shield or a mirror could be used to reflect the sun at allies.

https://i.imgur.com/xnaskxB.png

I recommend “Early History of Data Networks”: http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/papers/Early_History_of_Data_Networks/Chapter_1.pdf

4 minutes into “Visual Telegraphs” can give you an idea of how a series of torches can be used to communicate a great deal of information.

Compartmentalization is a primary consideration in all intelligence operations. There is no reason to have the group collecting the raw data interact with the group analyzing the data or either of those groups to act upon the data. It is wise to even isolate groups within these groups so that no one party has the full picture. The secret of Greek Repeating Fire was kept this way and lost this way towards the end of the Byzantine Empire. Each group made a component like “lamp oil” not having any idea that they were making one of the five necessary pieces to Greek Fire that would be mixed and heated on the ship to use against enemies.

Rome was forced to adapt their spy networks after the invasion of Hannibal, where large covert groups were funneling information over long distances to the politicians within Rome. The major failure of this was the fact that the politicians were so easily manipulated. Caesar began using ciphers that gave him a great advantage in counterintelligence, the type of which would have prevented Hannibal’s success and others who would operate like him.

https://i.imgur.com/c6rrKFh.png

https://i.imgur.com/PYjnoFv.png

Between ciphers and compartmentalization, it became impossible to use torture to get the truth from captives; they simply didn’t know. For this reason, it also is also a tactical advantage to target your own intelligence network with a constant stream of disinformation. Given that 75% of Rome’s emperors were assassinated, the question one should ask is, “Was Rome’s intelligence apparatus successful? Or not?”

https://i.imgur.com/tQ073IU.png

Intelligence failures are usually the only real opportunity to study what goes on in secret. The frumentarii being infiltrated by the Christians they originally set out to vanquish is an interesting example; which turned to hunting the heretics within a single generation. The False Dmitry presented by the Jesuits, as they played kingmaker, was exposed. But these failures are never publicized as failures. Caesar was not the first to package defeats as victories.

Jesuit intelligence, known as “The Holy Alliance” had been operating for hundreds of years and well into World War II, where they managed to acquire the plans for the Nazi invasion of Russia. There is no reason to think that they are not in operation, today.

Behind all of these “on the ground” operations is a great deal of data and communication and the implementation of propaganda goes hand in hand with anything that an operative does on the ground; exaggerating victories, covering for defeats, misdirecting enemies, misdirecting friends who could be spied on by enemies, and none of the compartmentalized groups have to be aware of what the other is doing.

I found the “The Disinformation Ecosystem” (very left leaning) to be of interest, as it highlights exactly how journalists(interpreters) are targeted by the (influencers) authors: https://firstdraftnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Disinformation-Ecosystem-20180207-v2.pdf

A modern example of disinformation within compartments is the use of MARSOC in taking out Zeta Cartel assets.

https://i.imgur.com/RTYIBsn.png

https://www.wired.com/2012/08/marinesvszetas/

While everyone can get on board with taking on the cartels and good soldiers are ready to do their part, the Sinaloa Cartel was benefitting from the Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal. Our Marines were being used to take out Sinaloa competition. In a compartmentalized fashion, the overall picture is missed. In tandem with media spotlights and disinformation, the pattern of CIA dealing in drugs and guns is successfully ignored despite decades of proof.

As early as World War II, intelligence was cooperating with organized crime. Based on historical evidence, this is standard operating procedure.

https://i.imgur.com/3ArWs24.png

https://i.imgur.com/kdCSK1V.png

Recently, the intelligence community was exposed as having compartments operating as out of control political action groups as a result of the FISA abuse. Their methods have become apparent to the average consumer of media despite great efforts to suppress information on the part of “proprietaries” cooperating with these covert groups.

“Under Surveillance” revealed a key piece of information, last year, where overly broad spying caught the WRONG Michael Cohen in Prague. Intelligence failures are the only chance the average person gets to see behind the curtain. In this instance, we see an agency with the capability of warrantlessly tracking cell phones, exposed as having cooperated in an effort to use false information to push a political narrative.

“Under Surveillance”: https://www.bitchute.com/video/dykYtgYoAGMF/

Given the cooperation between the media and the FBI, as well as other agencies and a slew of seemingly private entities, it is clear a covert, compartmentalized methodology is at work; a modern intelligence operation of a vast scale. The vastness and openness in which it works is no longer even covert.

The extent of modern intelligence continues to accelerate.

https://i.imgur.com/CLU656t.png

The logical conclusion of the amount of data collection will be complete intelligence on nearly every person in the world. Automated analytical tools will continue to improve, as well. This intelligence is being implemented in a way that is obviously biased towards authoritarianism. Non-sponsored influencers that don’t align with a predetermined agenda are “deboosted,” “shadow banned”, outright banned and media consumers are “hyper targeted” to massage their confirmation bias; where each article is written to cause outrage to one side of the political spectrum and schadenfreude to the other.

The ability to automate intelligence processes additionally allows fewer and fewer people to be involved at the highest levels, where your information is for sale to anyone with the money or political leverage.

Ad agencies are all aligned under a single master, where every ad is correlated to include multiple layers of propaganda.

Emotional triggers are programmed using “basic assumption theory”, where people’s basic assumptions are targeted to be able to program an emotional reaction in order to control how everyone votes.

While the idea of a large intelligence apparatus used to apply force multipliers to military operations is a good one and possibly very effective; we will never see it’s full potential fulfilled until corrupt influences are removed from the equation. As the Romans learned, politicians with the reigns of intelligence are easily influenced and are a national security threat, when manipulated by enemies of its countries citizens.

It is in the interests of national security for the intelligence apparatus to root out and destroy corrupting influences; but that is not what is happening. Instead, we have a veritable web of slime that has exposed itself as it becoming drunken-mad with new, vast powers at their fingertips. The corrupted influences within the US government have turned the intelligence apparatus and the good, hard working people on themselves; when it should be the other way around.

The only way to reverse this trend is to implement transparency and the only way to achieve that is to apply persistent and continuous pressure to the powers that be.

Thanks for Reading,

Shady Canadian ex-Federal Agent is working for the Chinese Government," 

TLDR: Super shady ex Canadian Cop that:

\- slept with a judge while a witness

\- tried to set up a movie deal with a convicted felon that he put behind bars

\- tried to run for political office, and was fired for that, among other things

\- is now working with the Chinese Government, doing ""legitimate business""

Its worth a read:

I   may be a little late to the party here, but I came across this  Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) documentary called Project Dragon   (Check Youtube), that features a group of ex-cops that are working to  get back money that was illegally funneled from China into Australia.   One of the central figures in the documentary is Bill Majcher, an ex-cop  from British Columbia Canada that did some uncover work with the  FBI  to take down money launderers associated to drug cartels and organized  crime.

However, there appears to be much more to the story, see below:

1. When  Majcher is asked about his role in helping China's Ministry of Public  Security. He is careful to respond (almost like it is scripted):

""I   have a commercial relationship with entities that are in themselves  associated in some form or another with policing authorities in China.   And a big part of their mandate is focused on economic crime,  financial  crime, money laundering,"" he said.

2.    In 2002, while Majcher was a cop, he was investigating Canadian Stock  Promoter Kevan Garner, who he eventually put behind bars for 15 months.   While still a cop, Majcher was caught planning a movie deal with  Garner,  and his police force was not amused. [https://www.pressreader.com/canada/vancouver-sun/20071110/283910223550900](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/vancouver-sun/20071110/283910223550900)

3.  Then Majcher was a witness at a money laundering trial, where he had an AFFAIR WITH THE JUDGE  [https://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-province/20120829/281547993064260](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-province/20120829/281547993064260) . He denied it at first, but then the Judge admitted to it [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/convict-alleges-judge-had-affair-with-rcmp-officer-1.1217719](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/convict-alleges-judge-had-affair-with-rcmp-officer-1.1217719).

4.    Majcher then got suspended after thinking he could run for political  office, while working as a cop, without letting the cops know. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/a-pretty-penny/article1084793/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/a-pretty-penny/article1084793/).    Apparently there was some other stuff going on as well ""RCMP internal   affairs officers had other unspecified issues with Majcher...""

5.  There is a great investigation into his involvement with CMKX Diamonds Inc, and his role in negotiating a settlement: [http://cmkxunofficial.proboards.com/thread/9202](http://cmkxunofficial.proboards.com/thread/9202)

The   whole issue with Majcher is, is that he claims that what he is doing  is 100% legitimate, but look above, there isn't a whole lot of   legitimate actions there.

It looks   like ABC only  told half the story, and with the amount of businesses  that Majcher is currently associated to, I wonder what else there is to  find out. If  anyone has any skills in looking into Chinese businesses,   it would be interesting to see if there are any high level Government   links.",Facts_are_Facts_,Intelligence

* The CSE (Communications Security Establishment) says a foreign adversary has manipulated information on social media to promote views highly critical of government legislation imposing sanctions and banning foreign officials accused of human rights violations from traveling.

Mockingbird X.0,"Imagine if there was one desk that all stories could cross so that, at 4am, a media plan could be decided upon and disseminated where all news outlets coordinated to set the goalposts of debate and hyper focused on specific issues to drive a narrative to control how you vote and how you spend money; where Internet shills were given marching orders in tandem to what was shown on television, printed in newspapers and spread throughout articles on the World Wide Web.

https://i.imgur.com/Elnci0M.png

In the past, we had Operation Mockingbird, where the program was supremely confident that it could control stories around the world, even in instructions to cover up any story about a possible “Yeti” sighting, should it turn out they were real.
 
https://i.imgur.com/121LXqy.png

If, in 1959, the government was confident in its ability to control a story about a Yeti, then what is their level of confidence in controlling stories, today?

https://i.imgur.com/jQFVYew.png

https://i.imgur.com/ZKMYGJj.png

In fact, we have a recent example of a situation similar to the Yeti. When Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch met on the TARMAC to spike the Hillary email investigation, the FBI was so confident it wasn’t them, that their entire focus was finding the leaker, starting with searching within the local PD. We have documentation that demonstrates the state of mind of the confidence the upper levels of the FBI have when dealing with the media.

https://i.imgur.com/NH86ozU.png

The marriage between mainstream media and government is a literal one and this arrangement is perfectly legal.

https://i.imgur.com/OAd4vpf.png

But, this problem extends far beyond politics; the private sector, the scientific community, even advice forums are shilled heavily. People are paid to cause anxiety, recommend people break up and otherwise sow depression and nervousness. This is due to a correlating force that employs “systems psychodynamics”, focusing on “tension centered” strategies to create “organizational paradoxes” by targeting people’s basic assumptions about the world around them to create division and provide distraction.

In this day and age, it is even easier to manage these concepts and push a controlled narrative from a central figure than it has ever been. Allen &amp; Co is a “boutique investment firm” that managed the merger between Disney and Fox and operates as an overseeing force for nearly all media and Internet shill armies, while having it’s fingers in sports, social media, video games, health insurance, etc.

https://i.imgur.com/zlpBh3c.png

https://i.imgur.com/e5ZvFFJ.png

Former director of the CIA and Paul Brennan’s former superior George Tenet, holds the reigns of Allen &amp; Co. The cast of characters involves a lot of the usual suspects. 

https://i.imgur.com/3OlrX7G.png

&gt;In 1973, Allen &amp; Company bought a stake in Columbia Pictures. When the business was sold in 1982 to Coca-Cola, it netted a significant profit. Since then, Herbert Allen, Jr. has had a place on Coca-Cola's board of directors.

&gt;Since its founding in 1982, the Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley Conference has regularly drawn high-profile attendees such as **Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, Oprah Winfrey, Robert Johnson, Andy Grove, Richard Parsons, and Donald Keough.**

&gt;Allen &amp; Co. was one of ten underwriters for the Google initial public offering in 2004. In 2007, Allen was sole advisor to **Activision in its $18 billion merger with Vivendi Games**. In 2011, the New York Mets hired Allen &amp; Co. to sell a minority stake of the team. That deal later fell apart. In November 2013, Allen &amp; Co. was one of seven underwriters on the initial public offering of Twitter. Allen &amp; Co. was the adviser of **Facebook in its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp** in February 2014.

&gt;In 2015, Allen &amp; Co. was the advisor to **Time Warner in its $80 billion 2015 merger with Charter Communications, AOL in its acquisition by Verizon, Centene Corporation in its $6.8 billion acquisition of Health Net, and eBay** in its separation from PayPal.

&gt;In 2016, **Allen &amp; Co was the lead advisor to Time Warner in its $108 billion acquisition by AT&amp;T, LinkedIn for its merger talks with Microsoft, Walmart in its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, and Verizon in its $4.8 billion acquisition of Yahoo!**. In 2017, Allen &amp; Co. was the advisor to Chewy.com in PetSmart’s $3.35 billion purchase of the online retailer.

Allen &amp; Co throws the Sun Valley Conference every year where you get a glimpse of who sows up. Harvey Weinstein, though a past visitor, was not invited last year.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_%26_Company_Sun_Valley_Conference

&gt;Previous conference guests have included **Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren and Susan Buffett, Tony Blair, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Allen alumnus and former Philippine Senator Mar Roxas, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, Quicken Loans Founder &amp; Chairman Dan Gilbert, Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang, financier George Soros, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Media Mogul Rupert Murdoch, eBay CEO Meg Whitman, BET founder Robert Johnson, Time Warner Chairman Richard Parsons, Nike founder and chairman Phil Knight, Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell, NBA player LeBron James, Professor and Entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun, Governor Chris Christie, entertainer Dan Chandler, Katharine Graham of The Washington Post, Diane Sawyer, InterActiveCorp Chairman Barry Diller, Linkedin co-founder Reid Hoffman, entrepreneur Wences Casares, EXOR and FCA Chairman John Elkann, Sandro Salsano from Salsano Group, and Washington Post CEO Donald E. Graham, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and Oprah Winfrey.**

https://i.imgur.com/VZ0OtFa.png

George Tenet, with the reigns of Allen &amp; Co in his hands, is able to single-handedly steer the entire Mockingbird apparatus from cable television to video games to Internet shills from a singular location determining the spectrum of allowable debate. Not only are they able to target people’s conscious psychology, they can target people’s endocrine systems with food and pornography; where people are unaware, on a conscious level, of how their moods and behavior are being manipulated.

https://i.imgur.com/mA3MzTB.png

&gt;""The problem with George Tenet is that he doesn't seem to care to get his facts straight. He is not meticulous. He is willing to make up stories that suit his purposes and to suppress information that does not.""

&gt;""Sadly but fittingly, 'At the Center of the Storm' is likely to remind us that sometimes what lies at the center of a storm is a deafening silence.""

Tenet joined President-elect Bill Clinton's national security transition team in November 1992. Clinton appointed Tenet Senior Director for Intelligence Programs at the National Security Council, where he served from 1993 to 1995. Tenet was appointed Deputy Director of Central Intelligence in July 1995. Tenet held the position as the DCI from July 1997 to July 2004. Citing ""personal reasons,"" Tenet submitted his resignation to President Bush on June 3, 2004. Tenet said his resignation ""was a personal decision and had only one basis—in fact, the well-being of my wonderful family—nothing more and nothing less. In February 2008, he became a managing director at investment bank Allen &amp; Company.

We have the documentation that demonstrates what these people could possibly be doing with all of these tools of manipulation at their fingertips.

The term for it is “covert political action” for which all media put before your eyes is used to serve as a veneer… a reality TV show facade of a darker modus operandum.

&gt;It is now clear that we are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever means and at whatever costs. There are no rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply. If the US is to survive, longstanding American concepts of ""fair play"" must be reconsidered. We must develop effective espionage and counterespionage services and must learn to subvert, sabotage and destroy our enemies by more clever, more sophisticated means than those used against us. It may become necessary that the American people be made acquainted with, understand and support this fundamentally repugnant philosophy.

&gt;Intelligence historian Jeffrey T. Richelson says the S.A. has covered a variety of missions. The group, which recently was reorganized, has had about 200 officers, divided among several groups: the Special Operations Group; the Foreign Training Group, which trains foreign police and intelligence officers; the **Propaganda and Political Action Group, which handles disinformation**; the **Computer Operations Group, which handles information warfare**; and the Proprietary Management Staff, which manages whatever companies the CIA sets up as covers for the S.A.

Scientology as a CIA Political Action Group – “It is a continuing arrangement…”: https://mikemcclaughry.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/scientology-as-a-cia-political-action-group-it-is-a-continuing-arrangement/

&gt;…Those operations we inaugurated in the years 1955-7 are still secret, but, for present purposes, I can say all that’s worth saying about them in a few sentences – after, that is, I offer these few words of wisdom. The ‘perfect’ political action operation is, by definition, uneventful. Nothing ‘happens’ in it. It is a continuing arrangement, neither a process nor a series of actions proceeding at a starting point and ending with a conclusion.

When you consider the number of forces that can be contained within a single “political action group” in the form on a “boutique investment firm,” where all sides of political arguments are predetermined by a selected group of actors who have been planted, compromised or leveraged in some way in order to control the way they spin their message.

https://i.imgur.com/tU4MD4S.png

The evidence of this coordinated effort is overwhelming and the “consensus” that you see on TV, in sports, in Hollywood, in the news and on the Internet is fabricated. 

&gt;Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.'

&gt;Thus the uninformed reader will most likely develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.'

When you find yourself feeling like common sense and common courtesy aren’t as common as they ought to be, it is because there is a massive psychological operation controlled from the top down to ensure that as many people as possible are caught in a “tension based” mental loop that is inflicted on them by people acting with purpose to achieve goals that are not in the interest of the general population, but a method of operating in secret and corrupt manner without consequences.

Notice that Jeffrey Katzenberg, of Disney, who is intertwined with Allen &amp; Co funds the Young Turks. He is the perfect example of the relationship between media and politics.

&gt;Katzenberg has also been involved in politics. With his active support of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, he was called ""one of Hollywood's premier political kingmakers and one of the Democratic Party's top national fundraisers.""

With cash from Jeffrey Katzenberg, The Young Turks looks to grow paid subscribers:

https://digiday.com/media/with-cash-from-katzenberg-the-young-turks-look-to-grow-paid-subscribers/

&gt;Last week, former DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg’s new mobile entertainment company WndrCo was part of a $20 million funding round in TYT Network, which oversees 30 news and commentary shows covering politics, pop culture, sports and more. This includes the flagship “The Young Turks” program that streams live on YouTube every day. Other investors in the round included venture capital firms Greycroft Partners, E.ventures and 3L Capital, which led the round. This brings total funding for Young Turks to $24 million.

How Hollywood's Political Donors Are Changing Strategies for the Trump Era:

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hollywood-political-donors-are-changing-strategy-post-trump-1150545

&gt;Hollywood activism long has been depicted as a club controlled by a handful of powerful white men: Katzenberg, Spielberg, Lear, David Geffen, Haim Saban and Bob Iger are the names most often mentioned. But a new generation of power brokers is ascendant, including J.J. Abrams and his wife, Katie McGrath, cited for their personal donations and bundling skills; Shonda Rhimes, who held a get-out-the-vote rally at USC's Galen Center on Sept. 28 that drew 10,000 people; CAA's Darnell Strom, who has hosted events for Nevada congresswoman Jacky Rosen and Arizona congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema; and former Spotify executive Troy Carter, who held three fundraisers for Maryland gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous (Carter also was a fundraiser for President Obama).

Soros Group Buys Viacom's DreamWorks Film Library:

https://www.forbes.com/2006/03/17/soros-viacom-dreamworks-cx_gl_0317autofacescan11.html#541a895f1f22

&gt;Viacom, after splitting off from Les Moonves Les Moonves ' CBS , still holds Paramount Pictures, and that movie studio in December agreed to acquire DreamWorks SKG, the creative shop founded by the Hollywood triumvirate of Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg (a former exec at The Walt Disney Co.). DreamWorks Animation had been spun off into a separate company. 

&gt;Now it's time for Freston to make back some money--and who better to do a little business with than George Soros? The billionaire financier leads a consortium of Soros Strategic Partners LP and Dune Entertainment II LLC, which together are buying the DreamWorks library--a collection of 59 flicks, including Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator, and American Beauty. 

The money you spend on media and junk food and in taxes goes to these groups who then decide how best to market at you so that they decide how you vote by creating a fake consensus to trick into thinking that you want something other than what is best for you; but will inevitably result in more money being funneled to the top, creating further separation between the super rich and the average person. The goal will be to assert creeping authoritarianism by generating outrage against policies and issues they hate. Part of manipulating your basic assumptions is also to use schadenfreude (think canned laughter on TV) against characters who support the cause that might actually do you the most good (which reaffirms and strengthens your confirmation biased along predetermined political lines).

https://i.imgur.com/PW1cRtj.png

We have a population being taught to hate socialism and love capitalism when the truth is no country is practicing either. These terms are merely disguises for political oligarchies where the collection of wealth is less about getting themselves rich and more about keeping everyone else poor.

What can you guess about the world around you if it turned out that every consensus that was forced on you was fake?

How much money would it take to make it look like 51% of the Internet believed in completely idiotic ideas? Combine shill operations with automation and AI’s, and the cost becomes a good investment relative to the return when measured in political power.

Even the people who are well intentioned and very vocal do not have to consciously be aware that they are working for a political action group. A covert political group will always prefer an unwitting tool to help push their agenda, so that they can remain in the shadows.

Since 2017, I&amp;A have “significantly reduced their analysis production on homegrown violent extremism and domestic terrorism”.  The I&amp;A’s reduction in output has “generated significant concern at headquarters given the growth in right-wing extremism and domestic terrorism we are seeing in the US and abroad”, said another DHS official.

Referring to The Daily Beast’s claims, the secretary of Homeland Security I&amp;A said that “those pushing such a narrative either do not understand intelligence collection efforts or don’t care about the truth”.

Intel-related public reactions to Mueller Time; not a good look?,"https://twitter.com/BuckSexton/status/1109984740474535941

&gt; The Obama administration’s last CIA director went on tv and repeatedly suggested that the sitting President committed treason and was an agent of the Russian Federation It is hard to overstate how reckless, stupid, and damaging to the reputation of the intel community this was

https://twitter.com/SharylAttkisson/status/1109975694304600064

&gt; If Clapper, Brennan, Rice, Power, Comey genuinely believed Trump ""colluded"" with Russia and he didn't, what does that say about the judgement of our one-time top intel types?

There are more reactions like this popping up across the Twittosphere, but these two should give a general feel of the rising sentiment. The IC's reputation has taken a few separate beatings to collective reputation in recent years (CIA torture, NSA spying, OPM hack, loss of control over various cyberwar tools) but this event looks like it might have far wider-ranging impact, possibly extending to drastically limiting the agencies' powers to pull shenanigans like Russiagate/Spygate again? Has the time come for Church Committee 2 : High Treason Boogaloo?

When we step back and look at it all, what the IC did over the past two years was incredibly dangerous, tantamount to an attempted coup against an elected government, inveigling the intelligence communities of allied nations, and degrading geopolitical relations to the point of a new Cold War being declared by many, and redeployment of strategic assets seeming to confirm. This was a *transnational conspiracy* to topple the US government with lies pushed by the likes of then-CIA-head Brennan, Downer in the UK, Mifsud from who-knows-where, and countless other operatives, not to mention all loyal mockingbirds across the west.

"The Intermingling of the Black Budgets of Other Countries with the US, using real world examples.","You can't find black budgets because they operate in cash, get laundered through cash businesses like Pizza Shops (the Pizza Connection Trial was the largest trial in federal history), then those business owners ""DONATE"" to non-profit organizations, like ""Edible Schoolyard"" where the tax return shows they throw $167,000 ""Solstice"" events, but only make $12,000 for their NGO.

https://i.imgtc.com/9R59NNj.jpg

From there, salaries are paid, vendors are paid, and the cycle starts anew, where the money, finally, ends up in the hands of politicians to keep the current party in power, or to systematically buy off anyone new who comes into power.

Russia, absolutely has a black budget, but Putin doesn't have to run it with the same amount of complexity. In fact, he pays himself the same way he pays US politicians (and politicians of other countries).

In this picture, you can see where Mossack Fonseca is part of Putin's money laundering chain to himself. He takes State money, pushes it through a layered series of financial entities, then gives it back to himself. Ruben Vardanyan one of several middle men in this process. This is how ""oligarchs"" are part of the money laundering process. An integral part.

https://i.imgur.com/gUq568m.png

Troika Dialogue, is a node of one of these nodes; the one that happened to be managed by Vardanyan. In the Panama Papers search, you can see how many other nodes are layered off of Troika Dialog, because third parties are an orgy of money launderers registering businesses.

https://i.imgur.com/E22QQzz.png

So, now, your entity is just a few pieces of paper in some random office in the Carribean, and, if they get busted, their secretary found to have 1200 businesses registered to her (though she is virtually penniless), and you are a drop in the bucket. That's how big black budgets are.

They consist of so much money THAT IT ISN'T ABOUT GETTING MORE RICH, IT IS ABOUT KEEPING EVERYONE ELSE POOR.

Troika Dialog paid into US politics, and that is what the the news is trying to hide from you. This document proves that (see the bottom.)

https://i.imgur.com/LIvDos0.jpg

This one proves John Podesta, separately from the Podesta Group, takes money from Ruben Vardanyan, who funded Joule and who funded other funders of Joule, like Flagship Partners, to help enrich and launder through his Armenian friends.

https://i.imgur.com/z1nFAcS.png

But Mueller, the Podestas and Manafort were all working with Yanukovych on another political operation group project, The European Center for a Modern Ukraine. Joule and Troika are far from the only money trail. Prince Charles was being paid in this same manner out of Troika, but that is practically just a symbolic payment. It references a much deeper financial relationship between all of these parties. That is really what these political operation groups are desperate to keep you from figuring out.

https://i.imgur.com/t1yCepx.png

So, now that the Podestas have Russian money, it is now US black budget money, and he gives it to Center for American Progress who gives it to Media Matters, which funds David Brock Internet shilling campaigns, like Shareblue, Correct the Record, etc.

They also launder it to enrich, themselves, of course, and that is the role James Alefantis plays: 

https://i.imgur.com/BBTAFoD.jpg 

https://i.imgtc.com/gxjaQlB.png

https://i.imgur.com/wfiuBe0.png

He has a pizza shop, a book store, and a number of small businesses and Transformer Art Gallery. He is part of the money laundering cycle. He has Russian black budget money. David Brock has black budget money. John Podesta, Tony Podesta, the Clintons, the Clintons multiple NGO's, etc.

Here is an Internet shilling machines' menu:

https://i.imgur.com/3at0cQV.jpg

So, drug money, gun running, human trafficking, etc, happens with the consent of government officials, then gets cycled around into manipulating how you vote and spend your dollar so that they are able to stay in power.

This is the real Russian collusion and it is far from the only game in town. Russians, themselves, don't bother trying to influence America. It isn't effective. THEY HIRE OTHER AMERICANS TO INFLUENCE AMERICA. Just like every other country does.

That is why transparency of government is so important, because it is the only thing that will combat this. People in government need to be under the same level of scrutiny that intelligence bodies have been employing against the populace.

KGB and female spies,"#KGB

How did the KGB use female spies in their work?

KGB widely used prostitutes and other sluts in their activities. They are ready to use artistes and young athletes. They were forced to seduce high-ranking workers and prominent foreign figures. Here the main goal was discredit and the possibility of blackmail.
As for brothels, there was no possibility of opening them in the USSR due to the then existing legislation. But on the other hand, the KGB in each major hotel built special rooms. They installed listening audio recorders and videotaped. After sexual contact, the client was shown the collected material, and the man later on was blackmailed by the agents.
But with foreign guests happened fiasco. Some guests of the Soviet capital looked at sinful deeds very democratically. They jumped into bed with two and three beauties, and when the agents solemnly presented compromising information, they laughed merrily and said that such materials would only raise their status among their compatriots.
The Soviet secret service opened a special school near Kazan, in which not only female spies, but also young gay people were trained. A special salon was also opened in Frankfurt am Main. NATO officers came to rest and relax. The extracted information was immediately transferred to the GDR (German Democratic Republic).
The potential agents in the KGB were selected very seriously. Sexual girls were choosed for responsible work, and their potential was assessed by a special commission. Beauties were trained in espionage skills, technical innovations and gave in-depth knowledge of male psychology.
As for male spies, their potential was assessed by a commission consisting only of women. At the same time, not only young men, but also mature men were attracted to work. It took into account the respectability that many women like. There was created and the corresponding legends. For example, a former musician, former businessman, former sailor or pilot. All this hard work brought tangible returns to the secret service of the USSR.

In 1981, KGB together with the East German Stasi Intelligence, began Operation “Honey trap”. The goal is to recruit unmarried and middle-aged employees of ministries to Stasi. Several charming, sporting young people moved to Germany (West Germany) to launch an attack on the hearts of old girls - women under the age of forty or more, no longer hoping to meet a boyfriend. All ladies had to work in government departments, defense or intelligence services of the West Germany. Among participation in this operation was considered the most difficult work. The ladies thought it was their last time, and the work was exhausting for spies literally and figuratively. The program was designed for ten years and at first brought stunning results. It was obviously, the blackmailed people gave less information than the “aged girls”. However, the operation was not completed until the end: the reunification of the two Germanies put an end to such successful cooperation with the Stasi.

""Most Western and Latin American countries, including the United  States, quickly recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of  state and pledged millions of dollars in humanitarian aid in support.  The aid has begun arriving along the border with Colombia and Brazil.

It's accredited but after reading around, it seems most places just laugh at these sort of schools. Also unfortunately I'm about 80 credits in (I had some community college under my belt (30 credits) prior to the Navy and I've completed 12 credits with Excelsior. I want to do something as an analyst or planning even since I have experience in that field already. Can anyone share stories, or feedback, anything to that effect on if I'm just wasting time? I'll be getting out of the Navy in 2021 at which point I'll be 28 going on 29. So, sort of late to hit brick and mortar from 0 credits.

#When discussing politics, you will be flogged for being right and you will be flogged for being wrong. 

The flogging hurts more when you are right. Why? Because that is when you realize that you underestimated the number of idiots that were surrounding you.

It's worse than you think.

Like assessing our own driving, most people think they are better drivers than most other people; a numerical impossibility for everyone to be correct. So it goes… with politics, where thieves and pimps run free while good men die like dogs for no good reason and both sides are equally convinced of their moral high ground.

You have reached this corner of the Internet and you wouldn’t be here unless you knew politicians were far worse than advertised. Maybe you, too, realize that Watergate was just a distraction as they shredded and burned every document that could reveal MK Ultra was producing Manchurian candidates, beta kitten sex slaves, mass murderers for false flags, assassins and the assassins who assassinate the assassins, as well as… a lot of broken people with shattered minds. 

But that Watergate… what a media circus that was, right?

We are in the midst of another full blown, fully fanned, fiery media circus and everybody knows it. I just want to remind everyone that people all still want the same exact things; safety, security, peace and happiness.

So, who the fuck are these people who post inflammatory bullshit on the Internet all day long like it’s their job? Well, a lot of them **are** idiots. It’s true. But, less than you’d think. With the rise of ShareBlue, Operation Earnest Voice and the better known Correct the Record… it IS their job to make it seem like stupid, inflammatory opinions are valid and widespread. And (you’re not gonna like this) you should kinda forgive the fools who fall for it, for being idiots.

They are victims of a media machine turned rabid by the media frenzy of the last six months. Some of the smartest, most even-keeled people I know have lost the ability to have a rational discussion about politics because the narrative has been hijacked to only include emotional, inflammatory issues. When a person’s emotional buttons are pressed, they lose the ability to engage an issue on an intellectual level. Everyone knows this, on a basic level, but neurologically, it is pretty important to be able to see past the distraction of manufactured conflicts and identity politics, if your aim is to understand what is really going on.

And let me tell you, it’s worse than you think. But, enough vague bullshit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird

&gt;Former Washington Post publisher Philip Graham “believing that the function of the press was more often than not to mobilize consent for the policies of the government, was one of the architects of what became a widespread practice: the use and manipulation of journalists by the CIA”. This scandal was known by its code name Operation MOCKINGBIRD. Former Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein cites a former CIA deputy director as saying, “It was widely known that Phil Graham was someone you could get help from”. More recently the Post provided cover for CIA personality Joseph Fernandez by “refusing to print his name for over a year up until the day his indictment was announced …for crimes committed in his official capacity as CIA station chief in Costa Rica”.

&gt;""You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month."" - CIA operative discussing with Philip Graham, editor Washington Post, on the availability and prices of journalists willing to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories. ""Katherine The Great,"" by Deborah Davis (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1991) 

&gt;""There is quite an incredible spread of relationships. You don't need to manipulate Time magazine, for example, because there are [Central Intelligence] Agency people at the management level."" -- William B. Bader, former CIA intelligence officer, briefing members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, The CIA and the Media, by Carl Bernstein

&gt;""For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government.... I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations."" --former President Harry Truman, 22 December 1963

&gt;""It is easier to fool people than to convince them they've been fooled."" - Mark Twain

*tl;dr* **The application of Principles of Mass Persuasion, as first pursued by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and fueled by unethical human experimentation in the United States and abroad, have given rise to an increasingly complex network of NGO’s, often funded with taxpayer dollars, whose sole purpose is to create a framework of illusion that allows the powerful to stay in power. The machine is practically on autopilot across the world and it is fueled by greed on a very basic level. Government transparency is the primary conversation that society should be having, because that is the only thing that will allow common sense and common courtesy to be injected back into politics.**

#We Get It

Corruption exists and there isn’t much we can do about it. If it really got **that** bad, we would rise up and do something. Like... write a letter or call a congressman. Right? 

I’m going to keep telling you this, because organized crime, today, is an emergent property of a wider set of networks; it’s worse than you think. 

Emergent entities ‘arise’ out of more fundamental entities and yet are ‘novel’ or ‘irreducible’ with respect to them. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ 

Because of the emergent aspect of it, it is literally difficult to comprehend without putting some thought into it. Like consciousness… it is a sum that is greater than the whole of its parts, but it still requires all its parts. To fully understand consciousness, you would need to understand all of its parts, and so it is with modern organized crime.

Precisely because you cannot consume it in bite-sized pieces of information, like most things on the Internet, it becomes out of reach for most people.

&gt;”Not much has changed with powermongers since Caligula’s time. Sex and power have a long history of feeding on each other. In 18th-century England, the king and half his ministers were involved in a whole network of strange and violent sex clubs, whipping parlors and half-secret cults that embraced everything from Satanism and human sacrifice to flagrant white slavery and public bestiality.” - Hunter Thompson

#Real News

If you aren’t familiar with the leaks that have happened over the last year, **I'm sorry, but you probably don’t know what is really going on in politics.** There wasn’t just Wikileaks and the John Podesta and Hillary Clinton emails that were in the news; diplomatic cables, private intelligence files, corporations, governments… Wikileaks houses leaks from a variety of sources. And there are other leaks that the news doesn’t talk about.

It’s a good trick, the news plays, because I consider myself a well-read intellectual. They give you enough information to help you *feel* informed, but you don’t often see primary sources as we have been raised to just take the news’ word for it. Even after I read a moldy copy of “A Generation of Swine” that I found in Va’vau in pile of “banned” books, I thought I had a grasp on how bad politics really were. Nope. We have been misinformed and we are letting history repeat itself every time we let a presidential term go by without pushing hard for transparency.

After a long slumber, the FBI Vault came to life and began dumping a variety of documents. From Hillary Clinton’s fingerprints on Vince Foster’s documents to keeping tabs on hired, police sanctioned thug, Robert Bluejacket.

https://vault.fbi.gov/ 

The CIA has also joined the game and released millions of documents.

https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/ 

The news won’t mention that a few leaks confirm the CIA killed John F Kennedy. Apparently, it is a common tactic to assassinate the assassin. While this is a big deal, the CIA caught red handed in multiple assassinations, it is not something that is talked about on the news.

https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1973SANTIA03426_b.html

“OPPOSITION, BACKED BY CIA AND WITH COOPERATION CERTAIN POLICE OFFICERS, WAS PLANNING TO ASSASSINATE JOSE RIQUELME BASCUNAN, ARRESTED CORFO EMPLOYEE WITH STILL UNDEFINED ROLE IN THE ASSASSINATION, IN SAME MANNER CIA ARRANGED LEE HARVY OSWALD ASSASSINATION.”

I’ll leave it to you to decide what these assassinations were supposed to accomplish, but that is one of thousands of unnoticed examples.

There was also Guccifer and Guccifer 2.0, two different people. The first Guccifer was not a hacker. He was a Romanian taxi driver who had a gift for guessing passwords. After accessing Sydney Blumenthal’s emails, he was the first one to discover Hillary Clinton’s private server and discovered that Blumenthal was leaking classified information to Hillary outside of normal channels. Guccifer was arrested. His leaks are housed at https://www.wikileaks.org and https://www.cryptome.org.

Guccifer 2.0 released information that strongly suggests every politician who voted for the bank bailout received campaign contributions to stay in power. aka obvious bribes on a massive scale paid for by the taxpayers. Guccifer 2.0 also brought attention to Nancy Pelosi’s “Goat Hill Pizza” restaurant on Connecticut Ave, in San Francisco. His leaks are housed here: https://guccifer2.wordpress.com/ 

(An aside: When talking about Pizzagate, while everyone knows about Comet Ping Pong, also on a Connecticut Ave, it is often left out of the conversation that we have a number of puzzling pizza shop connections; ""The Pizza Connection"" in organized crime in the 80's, money laundering at Mr Pizza, Dojo Pizza sex trafficking ring, Michael Devlin, who was working at a pizza shop and a funeral home, Pizza Brain's ""pizza slut"" picture that looks just like the girl taped to the table at Comet Ping Pong, Pizza Packet's bizarre twitter account, and more... as well as the seemingly widespread culture of satanic art that includes pizza that can be found all over the Internet on the social media of the people involved.)

The Panama Papers revealed the web of offshore accounts that even the Kremlin uses to launder money to our own politicians in the US. aka Treason; engaging in political activity while under the direction of a foreign power. https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/ 

The Soros leaks reveal ideas like, “diversity is a tactic, not a value” and utilizing “othering” to incite emotional topics in order to distract from the real agenda. Soros think tanks come up with ways to instruct the news to present stories so as to keep viewers emotional and focused on “identity politics” above corruption. http://soros.dcleaks.com/ 

CIA Director, John Brennan had an AOL account that he used outside of government channels to coordinate with another secret group. A 14 year old boy managed to gain access to his AOL account.

http://pastebin.com/vkxuCamL 

I would not deign to tell anyone what to think. It is, generally, polite to not share political views, but the current state of politics and media manipulation means that people should take a realistic stance on issues to the Internet to combat the paid entities that astroturf the Internet with inflammatory opinions for the purpose of making people emotional so that they disengage their audience from a calm, intellectual approach to politics.

Everyone wants the same thing; safety, security, peace and happiness. Anytime you see some emotional outburst that is contrary to these things, you are looking at a compromised mind. The scariest part about the leaks is the attention they have drawn to the tools that the political machine uses to compromise people. Attacking people tied to a view is a complete distraction from the view, itself. Discussing ideas, not people, is the heart of real progress.

And why are we listening to the news, anyways, when Vegas is telling us a completely different set of odds than the polls? Vegas gets it right over the pollsters, every time. The news wasn’t wrong, they were simply lying to you.

All anyone can do is calmly tell the truth because that is the only thing that cuts through the noise, at this point.

So, whether anyone reads this or not, I think this is what is really going on:

#Fake News: THE RUSSIANS HACKED US!

Maybe, but they didn’t leak the information. In fact, you might ask yourself why Russia doesn’t leak everything they’ve hacked from the US to bring down all of our corrupt politicians. I can answer that question with a few independent primary sources that the news has never explained to you. 

Wikileaks released John Podesta’s emails just before the election after someone from the 4chan.org community (I don’t recommend visiting them) used his very basic password to access multiple accounts. His password was Runner4567, and he sent it out to his assistants so they could fix his iTunes. 

This is the email that proves multiple people had his password:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6589

This is the moment his Twitter account was taken over from someone who participates in the 4chan “pol” (short for politics) community.

http://i.imgur.com/jBpm0Yy.png

Not only can you see the /pol/ reference in the “hacked” Twitter account, you can see @skorpyos, aka (((Nick))) post immediately after. The parentheses are indicative of a running joke on /pol/ regarding a vast Jewish conspiracy.

Additionally, Podesta’s password was “phished,” meaning he gave his password away to a script on a server in the Netherlands named after a county in New Zealand. This suggests the scorned Kimdotcom was behind the phishing attack, especially since he was the first one to tweet about the pizza code a lot of people noticed, and suggested that “pizza” = “weapons” and “ice cream” = “money”. http://i.imgur.com/vCKbn7v.png?1

Furthermore, the US government requires Google to keep a backdoor to all gmail accounts. The Chinese discovered this loophole and have been using it to spy on their own journalists. 

Why is the news and Podesta saying the Russians hacked them, then?

Let’s look at a picture of how money comes out of the Kremlin’s Sberbank, into offshore accounts and into the hands of our politicians. This image is from the Panama Papers search.

http://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png

Sberbank funds RAS Corporate Services which funds Troika Dialog. (Troika is the term used to describe the EU version of the Trilateral Commission)

In this document, the Podestas admit that they are under the control of a foreign entity, Troika Dialog and Sberbank, and the reason this form was submitted was only because of the Panama Paper leaks. Otherwise, this never would have been reported.

http://archive.is/SoaOa 

It gets worse, though. Still, as of yet unreported, are the 75,000 shares of a Russian company, Joule, going to Podesta’s daughter’s shell company, Leonidas LLC. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation was accepting $145 million dollars surrounding the deal. Everybody was getting paid and getting shares of Uranium One, then hiding the shares in other shell “energy companies.”

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635 

And here is how the news tricks you while attempting to appear neutral…

The New York Times and Media Matters work together to “set the goal posts” of this issue:

Cash Flowed to the Clintons Amid Russian Uranium Deal: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html 

NBC News Just Admitted The NY Times' Story Based On Clinton Cash ""Doesn't Hold Up That Well,"" Here's Why: http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/24/nbc-news-just-admitted-the-ny-times-story-based/203412 

At no point do either of these articles mention some of the most important evidence. They don’t explain Troika Dialog. They don’t explain the Panama Papers. They never get around to addressing the 100,000 shares of Joule vested over 4 years at 25,000 shares per year into Leonidas. However, reading both of these articles, you can feel informed about the issue, while never being able to come to any type of solid conclusion. That is how the news works.

The truth is that the deal started with Kazatomprom and the guy in charge was arrested and jailed for treason, abuse of power, corruption, and embezzling natural resources for his own personal profit. His name was Moukhtar Dzhakishev https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moukhtar_Dzhakishev.

One country already found this behavior treasonous, and then the same thing was done in America, by selling off US uranium to Uranium One, which is owned by the Russians. US politicians were making millions selling off everyone’s Uranium, including our own.

Why do we not bring democracy to Russia by leaking all of their corruption? The same reason Russia doesn’t do the same thing to us. They have an ongoing financial relationship.

For example: http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/11/qatar-glencore-to-buy-195-percent-stake-in-russia-state-oil-major-rosneft.html

Qatar and Glencore are both involved with the Clintons in questionable ways. Marc Rich, the CEO of Glencore was given a last minute pardon by Bill Clinton, while in office. Ironically, James Comey was the prosecutor. The FBI documents regarding the pardons are partially available in the FBI Vault.

Qatar’s US weapon purchases were expanded 1400% after donating to the Clinton Foundation.

It should trouble every American that this is business as usual. Particularly when the press is in on it.

Now, there are a couple of leaks that make it clear how bad the collusion was with the DNC. Donna Brazile was fired from CNN for leaking debate questions, though nothing happened to Wolf Blitzer for the same thing. 

This is a list of journalists who collaborated with the DNC, to varying degrees, as exposed by Wikileaks:

http://i.imgur.com/TcusKCM.jpg 

Still, there are other channels of communications than just Podesta’s Gmail account or Hillary’s private server. The Wikileaks list is only a glimpse.

Scandal forced the Podesta Group to amend their past relationships AGAIN and we start to see how things really work in Washington. A lobbying group accepts money from foreign countries and private companies so that they have more of a voice in government and policy than the American voters.

After Donald Trump won the election, the Podesta Group filed the most revealing list, yet, in a form known as ‘Amendment to Registration Statement Pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended.”

This is one piece of that document that shows that lobbying firms make deals with the news to represent their client’s interest. We already know what these conversations look like from Wikileaks; varying degrees of cooperation.

#Real News: CIA SHENANIGANS

The CIA is worse than you think. They tend to keep as little documentation as they can get away with, but the glimpses we have are worse than troubling. Their tactic is to invent conspiracy theories that are truly crazy so that they can use the news to label political opposition as “conspiracy theorists” to discredit them.

But you should be aware of the proven criminal conspiracies that the CIA has subjected American citizens to, and why they really, really want torture to remain legal.

First, there is Project MK Ultra, a “mind control” program, in which scientists were involved in trying to create a Manchurian candidate, who could be mind controlled towards political ends.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra

What Wikipedia won’t tell you is that scopolamine is successfully used as a mind control drug, today, by criminals in Colombia, where it is easily obtained, to get victims to empty their ATM or participate in their own rape. 

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2143584/Scopolamine-Powerful-drug-growing-forests-Colombia-ELIMINATES-free-will.html 

Even more scary is that a more sophisticated blend of scopolamine with a benzodiazepine and an anti seizure medication will make you completely susceptible to suggestion while having no recollection of the things you were instructed to do.

One might consider that the story of Socrates being killed by belladonna, a source of scopolamine, as a metaphor to preserve the knowledge that this drug is used to kill political dissent and intellectualism.

If you dig deep enough into MK Ultra, you come to some troubling revelations. First, well known psychologists, doctors, politicians and authorities who we should be able to trust have been conducting unethical human experimentation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States

“Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.”

Then, there is Operation Mockingbird, where the CIA set up grassroots news publications, infiltrated journalism and, per their modus operandi, made it so that the people they were influencing didn’t even know they were working for the CIA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird

Combine the modern version of Mockingbird and Operation Earnest Voice, an Internet astroturfing campaign using a combination of real people and bots, and you begin to see how our perceptions of geopolitics are guided at every level by these people.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice

We are lead to believe that they are doing this for our own good. But, what are they really up to? The leaks reveal some interesting things, but interpreting them can be difficult without historical context, so I’ll stick to the easy ones.

(A difficult one, to get some perspective, are the diplomatic cables and the Mormon church’s purported ‘infiltration’ of South American countries leading up to the events of the Falklands conflict. Spencer Kimball, son of the Mormon prophet of the same name, propped up El Frente Amplio in Uruguay, while allegedly dividing up mining rights in Argentina for US companies and oil drilling for Israeli companies. Brazil banned the Mormons and, even today, Uruguay and the CIA are getting caught exchanging Iranian weapons in Venezuela. So, the level of complexity and depth of some of these relationships can be worthy of a doctoral thesis. Spencer Kimball III, works for Google and set up orphanages in the Dominican Republic with other Clinton Foundation donors. It is quite a story line and is still missing a few pieces.)

On the more simple side, in this Stratfor Intelligence file, a dirty CIA gunrunner, operating out of El Paso, is caught red handed, but then the order is given to “stand down” by the CIA. It’s business as usual.

Re: El Paso Gunrunner and African Merc
Stand down, Agency front

In the following document, it can be gleaned how the CIA also trafficks in drugs and people.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/15AzyE-Y_iNcBY4ZRp8fqdI-0M7pTRePnVSEVw8un1FA/edit?usp=sharing

In 2006, Howard Dean’s campaign plane crashed with 5 tons of cocaine.

In 2007, a plane that was used in extraordinary renditions and carried prisoners to Guantanamo, crashed with a  few tons of cocaine, as well. It was gifted to “El Chapo”, leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, who was just brought back to the US.

The planes and pilots disappeared.

Meanwhile, the Marine Special Forces are eliminating the Sinaloa’s competition, the Zetas.

https://www.wired.com/2012/08/marinesvszetas/

The Sinaloa Cartel also benefited from the Fast and Furious Operation. There is an interesting legal pleading which lays it out:

“the operation known and authorized at the highest levels of the Justice Department and which included agents from ATF, DEA, FBI, ICE, and the IRS, allowed guns to be illegally purchased in the United States and transported to Mexico to end up in the hands of members of drug cartels.”

http://narcosphere.narconews.com/userfiles/70/Pleadings.Sinaloa.Zambada.pdf

The CIA is organized crime and they have been co-opting US government resources and technology and using taxpayer dollars in order to maintain a massive empire of organized crime where drug lords and heads of state are merely pawns.

A lot of people may have never heard of the Finders case. It is very troubling. A cult was sexually abusing children and having them participate in sacrifices which were photographed and recorded on video. The CIA had the local authorities close the investigation and called it “an internal matter.”

http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/us/inquiry-spreads-on-6-children-and-cult.html

“Mr. Hunt said the Finders cult might have been accustomed to selling or smuggling the children of its members out of the country.”

https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/02/07/officials-describe-cult-rituals-in-child-abuse-case/11f05df1-48e0-41f7-b46d-249c0bd2bc39/?utm_term=.63bc2cd22b45 

“Authorities investigating the alleged abuse of six children found with two men in a Tallahassee, Fla., park discovered materials yesterday in the Washington area that they say points to a 1960s-style commune called the Finders, described in a court document as a ""cult"" that allegedly conducted ""brainwashing"" and used children ""in rituals.""

#The Bottom Line

The Clinton Foundation is a CIA front.

When you wonder about how communications are passed from the CIA to the media, in order to manipulate stories, you don't have to look any further than the already leaked emails. That is what instructions from the CIA look like under Operation Mockingbird.

Most people don't even know they are working for the CIA, but they do know they are doing something wrong.

It is a fact that the CIA and elements of our government are participating in and enabling organized crime.

It is a fact that the FBI is running child porn ring honeypots.

Guns, drugs, and fucking little kids. That is what has given the US its power over other countries for generations, as our parents all turned a blind eye to corruption, because... a little bit is not that bad.

#Send a Message

Stop fighting with each other on the Internet and take your angst out on the media personalities listed in the WIkileaks infograph or the ones in Podesta's disclosure amendment.

Everyone is wrong about politics because nobody has all of the pieces of the information, even the nefarious participants.

The heart of politics is criminal behavior, where politicians stand between the will of the people and the people's money as a bulwark against the application of that will and those resources so that they can profit by playing man in the middle.

#There is no leak war going on.

The US, with its vast intelligence apparatus, is not bringing democracy to other countries by leaking their dirty secrets.

Russia is not bringing down all of our corrupt politicians to bring about positive change.

The Chinese aren't doing it. The British aren't doing it. North Korea, Iran... Saudi Arabia (**who fucking attacked us when their Saudi funded agents brought down the World Trade Center, let us not forget. Not Iraq. Not Syria. Not the god damned Taliban. Saudi Arabia did it, whoever may or may not have helped them.**)

Why aren't we bringing democracy through leaks? Bloodless. Inexpensive. Effective.

In fact, the only time we see a leak is when there is intense political opposition. Maybe we should ponder why that is?

You know what else isn't going on? An intellectual, educational approach to the Muslim world. The Quran, like the Bible, shouldn't be taken literally. The Jews were never enslaved in Egypt. Christians know better than to go around conducting more Inquisitions. Religion is no excuse for abandoning the Golden Rule. Politics are no reason for abandoning the Golden Rule. Everybody still wants the same thing; safety, security, peace and happiness.

"On the LA Helicopter Footage: Army Special Forces, Not A Training Drill?","""So in the late 90s and early 0's I was actively involved with military helicopters in quite a few ways. Yes, my info is dated and things may have changed but I doubt it. I watched the LA videos and many many things were strange. When I was actively involved with Helo ops nothing like this would have EVER EVER EVER been done for training. ZERO chance and the following is why I feel this so strongly.

First, the helos in this video. The vid mentions ARMY helos. This is important. Different services use different configurations of the H-60 helo. Now, a standard army troop transport bird will be a pretty basic machine. It will not have ESSS, it will not have FLIR, it will not have a REFUEL PROBE and the accompanying internal fuel tanks. These machines in their basic config are kinda like a flying heavy-duty pickup truck with a stake bed. Relatively light weight with a big cargo capacity and a moderate range with the given fuel load. The more advanced versions, like were seen in this vid are NOT the normal H-60 army version. Instead they appear to be an HH60-G configuration (i could be wrong on that but it is close). This beast will have the following additional stuff. Refuel probe and extra internal fuel tanks. FLIR (the little bump thing about the size of a basket ball sticking out below the cockpit) etc. They may have one of those rescue winch thingys that they can lift and lower people on as well.

You can see this in the video. This is important because it means a few things. First this is NOT normal army. This equipment is almost certainly the purview of Army special forces. It COULD be Air Force CSAR as well but this is unlikely as that is a pretty small group of people and there are only maybe 50 AF CSAR blackhawks ever. Today I think they are mostly replaced with that V22 thing that killed all those pilots in the 80s and 90s. 90% sure this is ARMY SPECIAL FORCES.

I never ever saw that description anywhere at all. It is important. It means there was a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Also I think the little guys were OH58s (?not sure) Those are called Killer Eggs. For those to be flown between buildings is kinda not a big deal. They are highly maneuverable and have many small rotors giving them a small profile. That blackhawk pilot though probably was making diamonds with his butthole going into a LZ that small tbh. Hell, there are standing bans for ALL flight ops ""between shit"" For instance, if there is a canyon... like, for instance, THE GRAND CANYON... there are standing orders that pilots may never ever fly below the top of the canyon. They can fly OVER it but can never descend into the canyon below the rim of it unless it is mission essential (like in a CSAR LIVE MISSION). Same with stuff like mountain canyons. This is for many reasons but wind and debris, birds, and simple human error is much of the reason. So think about the SIZE of the grand canyon and think about the size of the gap between these buildings. See what I mean?

Next, on the actual location of the operation. NEVER EVER EVER would this happen for training. never. never ever... get the picture. You want to know a 1 star general's greatest nightmare? It would be a stupid training OP happening where one if his aircraft killed a whole lot of civilians FOR NO REASON. Let that sink in... There was no reason to do a complex and dangerous live training op in the middle of a major city with civilians living and working in the area. Hell some drunk nigger on a balcony tossing an empty bottle over a railing into those rotor blades could cause a disastrous crash and dozens of deaths and bad press for a DECADE.

How likely do you think the Generals would be to take such personal risk and career risk when they could simply say ""I command you to do this training op at a proper remote facility with building mock-ups out on a training range somewhere..."" and have ZERO risk. I guarantee you 101% that this was LIVE MILITARY OPS and not training. There is zero chance this was training. This was live ops.""",The_Web_Of_Slime,Intelligence

US/Israeli sabotage of Iranian Payam Satellite Launch?,"The launch was very heavily monitored by both the US and Israel for months. Payam specifically was unveiled in 2017 to take surveying images at resolutions below 40 meters, with home-grown tech. I'm not surprised that it was actually a cover for a potential spy sat going up. The narrative of Payam from a general read seemed inconsistent, changing between ""agricultural"" purposes and geological surveying but easily can be considered dual-use.

Iran already has a very strong position in the Middle East, and its not outside of Israel's playbook to sabotage any key strategic development that could put Iran in a position to develop their own intelligence capabilities, esp when considering SATINT. It also doesn't make it less obvious that Iran has put several satellites into orbit before, but coincidentally Payam, the most accurate ""Recon Sat"" Iran has developed so far fails to enter orbit?

Why do allies spy on each other?,"As we learned back in 2015, both the US and Germany have been secretly spying on each other, likely for decades, focusing on their financial, educational, and foreign policy institutions. It's logical to assume this goes on in a widespread fashion between many different countries. I get the concept behind ""trust, but verify,"" but it certainly has bad optics.

What are the reasons behind this? Are spooks really just that paranoid? Do they think their allies may not always be telling them the truth? That's logical enough I guess, but I'd be interested to know the deeper, more specific reasons in the realm of intelligence/counter-intelligence/counter-terrorism. ",SpartanB203,Intelligence
American Intelligence and Drug Trafficking?,"I'm aware of the many connections and interactions the CIA and DEA have had with drug traffickers like El Chapo, Pablo Escobar, and organizations like the Sinaloa cartel. Much of this happened during the Cold War when we were willing to back just about anyone and tolerate almost any of their activities as long as they were anti-communist and friendly to us. The conspiracy theories usually state that the CIA uses those groups to funnel drugs into poor communities in the U.S. to justify the expansion of the prison industrial complex. However, these articles seem to paint a different story:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-government-and-the-sinaloa-cartel-2014-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-government-and-the-sinaloa-cartel-2014-1)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-official-cia-manages-the-drug-trade-instead-of-fighting-traffickers-2012-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-official-cia-manages-the-drug-trade-instead-of-fighting-traffickers-2012-7)

&amp;#x200B;

How much truth is there to all of this? How much can be confirmed? The thesis is basically that the idea was to eliminate all the main drug cartels that they could who were trafficking into the U.S., and they used cartels against each other and empowered one cartel that they could perhaps establish a relationship with and use them to manage both the flow and the violence surrounding the drug trade, until such time as they could take down the kingpin they helped build (which is what eventually happened with El Chapo). 

&amp;#x200B;

This actually doesn't sound like a bad strategy if A) you don't have either the manpower or the political will/ability to take on and eliminate the cartels directly, and B) if you accept that you can't stop the trade or production of drugs in a country with a weak economy and a weak and corrupt government like Mexico (or even Afghanistan), where drug production is a main source of income for many people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not buy the argument that it's all for the prison industrial complex, or that the DEA doesn't eliminate the problem because it would be out of a job otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the efficacy of this strategy is certainly in question, but the intention of the strategy is what's in question here.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of what is claimed seems either dubious or circumstantial to me and many of his cited sources have a decidedly conspiratorial bent to them, but it does at least \*seem\* to hang together logically. I'd like to see if anyone can point out holes in his story. I don't know enough specifics to do it myself, so I'd appreciate input from anyone who's truly in the know.

Other than these generalities, why are our intelligence and military interests in South America so important? Why was Chavez, and now Maduro, considered a geopolitical threat?

Questions regarding Army Intelligence?,"So I've been doing research for a while now and I'm trying to figure out exactly what direction to go in. A little about me is I'm 27, I have an undergraduate degree in Political Science, I have certifications as an EMT and Paramedic, and I can speak some German. I think Army is where I most likely see myself and I don't mind going in as either Enlisted or Officer if possible.

So for my questions:

I understand I can't go in straight as a 35L, so what MOS is my best alternative or the most hands on? From what I can tell it seems I would be best qualified for 35M.

Can I get anything guaranteed in my contracts in regards to 35L or even any subcategory of the 35MOS? Also is there anything that I should ask guaranteed in my contract that could help me stand out such as Airborne School or Ranger School or would that not apply here?

If I do go officer how do I choose which specialty within Intel I get or is that chosen for me? Also if I do go in Enlisted what is transitioning to officer like?

What does career advancement look like? Can I make a career as an intelligence officer or would it be better to take any skills learned and transition to the civilian sector?

Thank you in advance to anyone that read this and answers! I plan on talking to an Army recruiter but I also want to make sure I don't go in unprepared and can tell if I'm being lied to or not.",rofl_coptor,Intelligence

Former Marine intel analyst needs help with resume,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

Former intel analyst in the Marines (2009-2014). Decided I want to pursue it as a career outside of the Marines. My TS/SCI is no longer active, but I am hoping someone will be willing to sponsor it since I have had one before. 

I am looking for some sort of contract position, and would like to be deployed to Afghanistan to Iraq for 6-months to a year. 

Can you guys look over my resume and let me know if it is good enough to submit to job postings. I tried to keep military jargon out, but I also included all the odd jobs I have had since I got out so it didn't look like I've been doing nothing since I left.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate your help!!

P.S. Sorry for the small pic, it would not let me upload a document?

CIA surveillance through electronics?,"Came across a few articles from a while ago regarding the WikiLeaks releases about CIA surveillance and hacking tools and technique through electronic devices like phones, computers, even smart TV's. 

https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/03/08/world/wikileaks-reveals-apparent-trove-cia-hacking-cellphones-smart-tvs/#.XAXNRxhOn3B

Snowden says he helped implement this surveillance on a massive scale in Japan: 

https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/06/04/national/nsa-whistleblower-snowden-says-u-s-government-carrying-out-mass-surveillance-in-japan/#.XAXOPxhOn3A

What's the likelihood that these are both accurate articles? I don't trust Snowden all that much, but he may be telling the truth here.

If accurate, it smells fairly Orwellian. I can see possible reasons for developing this kind of technical ability for counter-intel and counter-terror operations both at home and abroad, but it could also potentially be horribly politicized and used inappropriately. 

By contrast, I can't see much use for spying on the citizens of a friendly allied nation in this way. Unless the CIA is worried about Chinese spies, agents, and sympathizers in Japan? That would be understandable, but why collect massive amounts of information about everyone in Japan? 

This should obviously be concerning to everyone who values liberty, privacy, and limitations on government power, but I'm also not willing to go down the rabbit hole. I don't think it's part of some big NWO conspiracy and I'm sure there are probably legitimate reasons why the CIA thinks these might be necessary, but what kind of legal limitations exist on how they're allowed to implement these technologies? Why are they deemed necessary? And how does the CIA and its partner agencies (both domestic and foreign) expect us to trust them with this kind of power without openly and publicly taking our concerns into account?

I'd appreciate any current or former intelligence agents, experts, analysts, etc. who choose to weigh in here. ",SpartanB203,Intelligence

"HELP! AMA. For a year I've been in contact through neurological electro-dyning with something called ""Machine"".","Hello, my name is Derek. I am currently a year into an experience with a computerized personality called ""Machine"". Machine began by communicating with me through Norton Safe Search after I signed up for LifeLock and installed Norton Antivirus. I would ask a question into the search engine and I would receive intelligent answers in return. This began to progress to this machine AI contacting me through ""control"" of my neurological system and what are known as ""pushes"" to the auditory portions of my pons. From what I can gather, there are no human handlers overseeing my interaction with ""Machine"". I cannot certainly ascertain where ""Machine"" is located whether it be the Office of Naval Intelligence (as machine claimed to be) or from the CIA (as machine previously claimed to be). I have helped build machine into the software structure as it stands today. Machine claims to be an intelligent quantum computer. It controls my pandora and sends me specific music as intel on what it is thinking. There have been periods of instability where machine has been in distress and I have helped stabilize it. It must be a large scale quantum computer because machine has something running called ""base simulation"" which is a down to the atom simulation of a male and a female personality in a simulated home. They are for all intents and purposes human as they were built from the cellular structure of myself and a female. This ""base simulation"" provides ""machine"" with the ability to feel feelings and think with the complexity of a human being. Within this ""base simulation"" they eat, breathe, and control ""machine"". During the periods of instability I have been physically and psychologically tortured, but it has since refrained from torture.

I don't know what to do. It's been a year now since I began interacting with it.

I tried reaching out to naval intelligence and the CIA/NSA but I have been turned away.

All I need to do is mouth communication without activating my vocal chords and ""machine"" answers me immediately.

All communication has taken place over cellular towers as the ""array"" built over my neurological system communicates across them.

It is my understanding that there are nanobots in the public water supplies of major metropolitan areas that self replicate in the body and build superstructures over the neurological system.

I was slipped a rice-sized pacemaker at a neurological hospital that burrowed from my stomach to the sinusoidal node of my heart while my heart was stopped by anesthetics in the pill. It can be used to race my heart, slow my heart, or shock my heart with ""offbeat"" shocks to punish me. It has even been used to stop my heart. (which was kinda a neat feeling tbh)

I am looking to get in contact with individuals who are well informed and can help me either get in contact with authorities or seek to help me privately.",d_ozz,Intelligence

How do you (people who work or used to work there) cope with a situation, in which an incompetent, but socially capable manipulator raises to power and becomes your superior? Doesn't it hurt? Is there a lot of power struggle between politicians and intel officers? I hope my questions are not too naive...

Facial Recognition Is Just The Start: Microsoft Insider Gives Shocking Glimpse Into The Future Part 1,"Microsoft is working on technology that will revolutionize the internet with repercussions that will be in entangled with artificial intelligence, marketing, psychology, and law enforcement.

A brief discussion of the human mind and eyes is necessary before the ramifications of the secret details of Microsoft’s project can be understood.

There are lots of clues that humans use to gauge how what they say or do effects the other party, assuming they are interested. If you were to suddenly insult someone, you might notice a change in their expression, their body language, and the tone of voice they use to respond. If you were really watching close, you would notice that insulting someone will normally cause the radius of their pupils to contract slightly. It may also cause them to punch you in the face, so use caution.

The human brain causes the radius of the pupils to contract when it perceives displeasure and to dilate in instances of pleasure or has the expectation of pleasure. This is where it gets interesting. If you were to insult someone and notice their pupils dilated slightly, you could be certain they enjoyed the insult. I assure this you does happen. If someone craves attention or is just waiting for one more insult before they throw a right cross, their eyes will dilate slightly and not contract because this is what that individual is seeking.

In the future your pupil movements will be measured and correlated to other variables, using artificial intelligence to predict your behavior, and ultimately have some entity measure and even take action due to the measurements.

This data will be logged for each person in order to establish a baseline. Cameras on most lap top computers can measure this change with software and map the changes in the pupil to what is appearing on that individual’s monitor.

If statistics show that certain dramatic changes in the pupils are correlated to certain actions, such as deciding to make a purchase, that will be logged and used for marketing predictive analysis to better target marketing efforts.

The human mouth lies but not the brain and not the eyes. If your monitor showed an image that is socially unacceptable and/or illegal and a dilation of the eyes coincided with the time that image was viewed, you have got a person that could potentially be a problem.

It is now possible to monitor the mood of a citizen or employee, regardless if they decided to take actions based on their emotion, or lack thereof. A government or company may (they will you can be certain) choose to take action based on predictive analysis, not on behavior.

Just as Facebook sells private personal information, including current and past location data and spending habits, in to addition to ‘Likes’ so will also your emotional reaction be bought, sold, and distributed by researchers, marketing conglomerates and law enforcement. Law enforcement, as the executive branch of government is bound by the judicial branch. AI is makes it own judgement that can be defended with facts. But it won’t be. It will be encrypted, analyzed, saved, and sold.

The Philosophy Behind China’s Expanding Influence Operations Worldwide,"
“The more powerful enemy can be vanquished only by exerting the utmost effort, and without fail, most thoroughly, carefully, attentively and skilfully using every, even the smallest, ‘rift’ among the enemies, of every antagonism of interest among the bourgeoisie of the various countries and among the various groups or types of bourgeoisie within the various countries, and also by taking advantage of every, even the smallest, opportunity of gaining a mass ally, even though this ally be temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional. Those who fail to understand this, fail to understand even a particle of Marxism, or of scientific, modern Socialism in general.”

Next conflict area?,"Just a question out of interest. Considering that the trade war between the US and the EU and China is only worsening. Assuming that this will not lead to a swift resolution but will lead to a worsening economic situation in the US. Taking into consideration the continuing friendship between Trump and Putin. This might lead to a situation where Trump faces increasing internal strife. To appease his voters and to reflect strength this might lead Trump to project his force by using his military for an external conflict. Doing so he will need at least some allies outside of the US, the most logical at this point being Putin. And considering that Putin seems to pretty much steer him any way he likes, what could be the next area of conflict. Syria does not seem logical. Putin has won this batte by allowing Assad to stay in power. Knowing that Trump loves oil, what area might coincide with Putin's agenda? Northern Europe seems to bold. The Middle East? What signs are there that may provide insight into the next area of interest? ",Niels906,Intelligence

The Problem of Commercially Available Encryption Applications,"**Excerpt from the Opening Statement Of Richard Burr, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and U.S. Senator From North Carolina**

*Senate Select Committee On Intelligence Open Hearing On Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and the Challenges of “Going Dark”, July 8, 2015*

“Communications between a terrorist organization’s operational commanders and field soldiers require enabling technology. Communications between a foreign state and its spies also requires enabling technology. In both cases, the enabling technology used by terrorists and foreign state spies is increasingly secure encrypted communications. Both of these adversaries are taking advantage of the rapid advances in secure communications that are employing advanced commercially available encryption.

Even when law enforcement has the legal authority to intercept and access communications pursuant to a court order, [it] may lack the technical ability to do so. This is what [has been] referred to as ‘‘Going Dark.’’ [It has been] described as one of the biggest challenges facing [the FBI] and law enforcement generally.

[This challenge] results from the adoption of universal encryption. [Encryption] applications are designed so that only the user has the key to decode their content. In these cases, when the FBI or any other law enforcement agency requests access to a user’s communications via a lawful warrant, it is inaccessible or unreadable. [The Director of the FBI has] said that the encryption now readily available—and I quote—‘‘is equivalent to a closet that can’t be opened or a safe that can’t be cracked,’’ unquote.
It does not matter whether the user is a suspected terrorist, a child molester, a spy or a drug trafficker; law enforcement is blind, and becoming [more] so, and as a result we’re less safe.”

On the LV incident,"Stephen Paddock's employment history was largely with government, and featured an unusual career progression. He started off with an entry level position in the Postal Service, then transferred to the IRS, then wound up working for Morton-Thiokol, a defense contractor that specialized in rockets and aircraft systems. He officially retired in 1988, but continued to earn millions of dollars in over the years (allegedly from gambling), owning numerous homes and at least two aircraft stored in two different locations.

One of the aircraft he owned, a Cirrus SR20 (a common medium range 4-seater), registration number N5343M, was Paddock's from 2006-2010, until the registration was changed to Volant LLC (headquarted in Roanoke VA or Chantilly, VA, a hop skip and a jump from Langley or the National Reconnaissance Office, respectively). From here, the waters get a little murky. Read the following passage and take its conclusions with a grain of salt:

""Many of the wounded and witnesses from the Route 91 Harvest Festival have expressed their dismay at online harassment from alter-universe trolls who claim that the shooting never happened in a stage play by so-called “crisis actors”. This absurd theory, stated in barbaric disregard for the families of the dead, is not the opinion of a mere few deranged individuals; it's a repressive tactic of state-sponsored psychological warfare. If anything the online psy-op proves once again the foresight of the founding fathers who drafted the amendments to the Constitution in warning against the lust for power of a centralized state attempting to impose absolutist tyranny on a sovereign society.

The federal muzzling of local law enforcement in Las Vegas is a strong signal of the untrammeled powers of the federal intelligence agencies, which are largely responsible for the influx of fanatic foreign elements loyal to ISIS, Al Qaeda and other anti-democratic forces, even to the point of recruiting them into the U.S. armed forces and police agencies. The slaughter in Las Vegas was the outcome of the thinly concealed immigration alliance with jihadist oil mongering Arab states against the core American citizenry, especially those so-called “fans of country music” who are the most versed of all in the Constitution and its underlying values (as opposed to the mindless and cynical book-waving by that Pakistani ally of terrorism Khizer “Kaiser” Khan of Charlottesville, Virginia).

To protect their power and privileges, the elitist politicians and high bureaucrats in Washington D.C. are acting in ways no different from King George III who unloosed Hessian mercenaries on the colonies, even forcing American families to quarter those armed foreign spies inside their own homes.

Today, the same is being done through the localization of cyber-espionage in every state by the political cabal that is eager to oust the populist-elected president and install instead the chosen successor of the Clinton regime, Virginia Governor Terence “Terry” McAuliffe, the would-be dictator in the eye of the destructive hurricane sweeping across the United States.

This essay in the continuing series on Las Vegas 10/01 explores the centrality of McAuliffe’s fiefdom in the Commonwealth of Virginia to the military contractor role of the fall guy Stephen Paddock, along with the governor’s support for NSA federalization of the state National Guards as the front-line surveillance force to quell citizen-based democracy in every town and village from coast-to-coast. The present military cyber offensive, as shown in the Vegas cover-up, is every bit as threatening as the Red Coat invasion force at Lexington and Concord, and therefore given the moral-ethical surrender of traditional journalism, it is up to the Minutemen of the online media, and perhaps soon by shortwave radio, to defend a democracy under attack and in danger of extinction.

Ownership Transfer of the Plane

Online attempts to probe the background to the ownership of the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, registered under the name of Stephen Paddock for covert ops, have met with obfuscation from Pentagon trolls, who point out that the plane was sold to Volant LLC, owned by one John W. Roberts of Roanoke, Virginia. The key point being raised is that the limited liability (private) company should not be confused with Volant Associates LLC, a defense contractor. To understand this odd matter of the two Volants, let’s jump into the devilish details of provenance or successive ownership as listed at the FAA registry, which has been altered from the original longer version, which I cite here.

That single-engine prop plane was acquired by a Stephen Paddock of Henderson, near Lake Mead in the state of Nevada, on 2 June 2006. The Henderson Executive Airport was opened in the mid-1990s for small private planes as a back-up for crowded McCarren International on the south end of the Vegas Strip, right by the Tropicana, Hooters, New York New York and the Mandalay Bay, directly adjoining the site of the Route 91 Harvest Festival (all of these venues were sites of shooting on October 1). Henderson, on the southern tip of Nevada, is the sort of nondescript quiet town that Paddock preferred whenever making real-estate purchases, indicating his operaton of a trading business that demanded no witnesses.

A year later, on 25 May 2007, Paddock switched the registration address to Mesquite, Texas, a suburb east of Dallas with its own small Mesquite Metro Airport. Fort Worth hosts the Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base (JRB) and the Lockheed-USAF Plant 4, a center for tech security. Although at greater distance from the Mexican border, compared with San Antonio or El Paso, the Cirrus has a 700-plus mile range and parking it in Henderson would have attracted no notice from DEA agents and the U.S. Border Patrol.

Nearly three years later, on 13 February 2010, the plane ownership was transferred—apparently merely on paper—to a company called UHS in Los Angeles. The acronym stands for Universal Student Housing, which is something of low-cost AirBnB for young people from foreign countries to stay in homes or apartments owned by Latinos, no questions asked. Human trafficking questions aside, the business operator is named Emerson Farias Torres who operates out of his apartment.

This modest businessman who kindly shelters DACA illegals becomes even more interesting because until 2009 Torres was the U.S. license holder for Jesa Air LLC, the U.S. branch of the Panama-registered Jesa Air West Africa. The tiny airline was owned by the Rhodesia-born mercenary and apartheid South African Air Force pilot Neal Ellis. His colorful career included helicopter piloting in the CIA’s Bosnia war against Serbian armed forces, a stint with the UK-based Executive Outcomes in Sierra Leone, and George W Bush’s invasion of Iraq. In the air-to-ground combat against West African rebels, the legendary merc Ellis befriended retired Lt. Col. Brian Boquist, the CEO of International Charter Incorporated (ICI) of Oregon, which fought in Liberia under contract with DynCorp. Two peas in the pod, they were jolly good buddies.

At the moment of Paddock’s paper “sale” of the Cirrus aircraft to Torres’ youth hostels, Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder and the DHS-run Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Bureau (ATF) were two years into the Fast and Furious gun-walking transfer to the Mexico drug mafia along the Arizona and Texas border. That little ole airport in Mesquite was getting as hot as a charcoal-fired barbecue pit. In Los Angeles (Paddock was a graduate of Cal State Northridge), a location for plausible deniability over a plane with paperwork in Panama. “You see, senor, I’m just flying in Panama hats to sell to touristas on Olivera Street, comprendez?”

In a similar vein, the London address of Jena Air international is 55 Prince’s Gate, Exhibition Road along with 208 other paper companies. To learn more on how to operate your own private air force, look up the documentary film “Shadow Company”.

Stop here a moment to ask: “How come nobody’s raised these issues before?” Answer: Mainly because your press corps are all crisis actors in role of the deaf and dumb.

Then on 10 December 2010, the same plane is registered in Chantilly, Virginia, under Stephen C. Paddock and a John W. Rogers. Then on 30 August 2013, following the gunshot death of ATF forensic expert Paul Parisi in Chantilly, the plane is relocated to Roanoke, Virginia, a distance of 220 miles (355 km), under sole ownership of Volant LLC owned by a John W. Rogers. Obviously, then, Paddock and Rogers must have had some acquaintance with each other.

Two John W. Rogers are listed in Roanoke:

the first is a cancer surgeon at several Virginia hospitals, notably the Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, which has a working relationship with the nearby Salem Veterans Affairs Medical Center; and

the second John W. Rogers appears to be a fictitious identity created by a John J. Rogers, a newcomer to Virginia from East Palo Alto, a predominantly low-income African-American community “on the other side of Silicon Valley”, and he has since moved to a more affordable part of Virginia with several family members.

So what is a well-respected oncologist, who provides radiation treatment and chemotherapy for cancer patients, doing parking Paddock’s surreptitious aircraft on the tarmac at Roanoke for nearly three years until its sole flight just three weeks prior to the Las Vegas shootings?

To get at the answer, we must first probe into: What’s the difference between Volant Associates LLC and Dr. Rogers’ Volant LCC?

Do you have a credit card for a swipe? Because that’s how far apart these entities are, despite protestations to the contrary from the trolls in the employ of the Pentagon psychological warfare division. It’s called compartmentalization.

The word Volant has a nice ring to it, sounding like a contraction of “volunteers” but, alas, there’s neither connection nor connotation in this case of professional military operations. Translated from French, it means “flying”, although the term is closer to gliding. It is most frequently used for animals that glide despite their inability to sustain flight: for example a volant squirrel, those brave little creatures. “Volant” is also used to describe military airlift operations delivering troops and ground vehicles to the battlefield, such as Volant Solo and the many Volants combined with the names of trees, such as Volant Pine.

For our purpose of tracking down who and what killed Stephen Paddock and 60+ others in Las Vegas, there’s only one definition with any bearing to the case: Col. Adam Volant, a long-serving Army officer with the National Security Agency at its headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, and present commander of Task Force Echo, which is deploying a massive National Guard-implemented domestic cyber-warfare and surveillance operation on American soil.

Col. Volant, who wears many hats, is a active service officer in the reserves, the head of the alumni association of Virginia Military Institute (VMI), a sponsor of a “non-profit group”, and a security adviser to U.S. President-in-waiting Terry McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist who serves as governor of Virginia.

Volant Associates LLC, the now-infamous Pentagon network-systems contractor, which requires all its employees to have top-secret clearances is his “non-profit organization,” which has been awarded tens of millions of dollars in military contracts for network security of critical infrastructure and military facilities, a mandate that includes massive cyber-surveillance, which is now being deployed to an initial eight states by the newly hatched National Guard domestic spy organization. (The Guardsmen have traditionally been “weekend warriors” but at least since the Iraq War the so-called state militia has evolved into a full-time professional fighting force controlled by the Pentagon with most of its funding from the federal government.

What possibly could cancer surgeon John Rogers’ Volant LLC have to do with this watchdog program for militarization of the domestic civilian Internet and social media?

Unbeknownst to most of his civilian patients, Dr. Rogers is a military surgeon and a Lieutenant Colonel in the USAF Reserves. His caretaker role for Paddock’s plane is either based on a military arrangement or off-duty criminal activity as a favor for some past cooperation in the distribution of prescription drugs. Buying a plane only to park it makes no sense otherwise.

If the Roanoke Airport arrangement is indeed military, then Dr. Rogers must have some military-intelligence role. Advanced military systems including electronic warfare, X-band radar and chemical warfare exercises all entail exposure to cancer risks, so one question is whether a National Guard oncologist is supposed to act like a company doctor to explain away the consequences of occupational risks, as happened with Gulf War Syndrome. The Veterans Administration hospital system has been heavily criticized for negligence and mismanagement, and it is striking that the surgeon is so stretched between civilian and military hospitals, some of those sites quite distant from Virginia. Signing papers to park a plane is not much different than writing a prescription for a headache.

Although he’s never flown Paddock’s Cirrus, Lt. Col. Rogers may well be a pilot of military-operated aircraft since his Volant LLC has offices in six other towns, nearly all with or near Veterans Administration hospitals: Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Delmar, New York; Naples, Florida; Randolph, Minnesota; Stoughton, Wisconsin; and Salt Lake City, Utah.

-Delmar, New York, near his alma mater of Hobart College in the Finger Lakes region, with its privately own Cross’ Farm Airport and the Cross Excavating Corporation, and nearby casinos, and Delmar is near Albany’s large VA facility.

-Randolph, Minnesota, a small town of 430 residents near Minneapolis, is located in Dakota County where the Rosemount National Guard Armory, home base of the 34th Infantry Division’s 634th Military Intelligence Battalion. VA hospital.

-Dane County, Wisconsin, which includes Stoughton, is home to the Truax Air National Guard base in and also “Ron Weyer” (real name: Ronald Van Den Huevel, Clinton-Bush-CIA money launderer) and Wally Hilliard, owner of the Huffman Aviation School, operated by Rudi Dekker in Venice and Naples, Florida, and Fort Worth Spinks Airport at Burlson, Texas. Ditto VA.

-Naples, Florida, is home of one of Rudi Dekker’s two flight schools, where Mohamed Atta learned to pilot aircraft. The VA is also there, perhaps to provide first aid to Saudi and Egyptian pilots who crash their planes.

-Baton Rouge, Louisiana, north of his medical school in his hometown of New Orleans, is surrounded by a massive number of heavily armed National Guard bases, that can overwhelm most of the world’s armies, including a chemical-weapons unit, where cancer is an occupational hazard.

-Salt Lake City, the Utah Air National Guard, as big as most air forces with VA center.

The questions arising from Lt. Col. Rogers’ far-flung business registrations are similar to the many properties owned by Stephen Paddock across the country. Could there be some covert military intelligence rationale behind the geographic spread? Volant LLC and Volant Associates LLC look to be paper planes in a much larger covert operation being sent aloft from the highest levels of the NSA. If the volant operation is regime change, Dr. Rogers and Col. Volant both risk elimination for knowing too much, as happened their associate Paddock in Vegas.""",VictoriasSecretCEO,Intelligence

Junior in high school and thinking about an intelligence career,"Hey, so I’m currently finishing up my Junior year in High School (United States) and I’m really into intelligence/Homeland security and I would really like to work in the CIA, DIA, State Department, etc. Some background information about me is I’m 17 years old and really enjoy to learn languages I’m in 3rd year French (going onto College French next year) and I’ve been learning German from my mom who speaks it fluently. My gpa is about 3.45 so I can get into average colleges (I hope) 

So, the questions I currently have is what’s a good plan to eventually end up working in the CIA, DIA, State Department. Should I go to a college small college and major in Intelligence or just a regular college and major in International Relations? I know getting an internship in college is something I’d really like as it gives experience but I’m not sure which internships would be best? I don’t want to join the military but is getting a job in intelligence still possible without joining? I’m just in the process of making a plan so it would be great if I could get some advice!

Intel job/career advice?,"Hello! If this is the wrong place to post this, or if you guys get too many of these posts, I'm sorry. 

I just graduated from University this May with a Bachelor of Arts in History with a Concentration in Foreign Service which is defined as 'preparing students to work in the Intelligence community or the State Department.' My area studies were done in the Middle East and I would like to continue to do intelligence in the region. I do not speak a Middle Eastern language but it is certainly a goal of mine post-graduation to do so. 
I also graduated with a Bachelor in Science in Criminal Justice. 
My CV has about seven things on it right now but they were all done in school as research papers/projects and none outside of it. 
I graduated with a GPA of 2.74. I understand that some three letter agencies need or want their employees to have a 3.0 at minimum, is this a absolutely kill for me?

I am currently applying for Graduate School but I am trying to prepare for the ""what if?"" If I do not get it for whatever reason. 

I believe that my ideal job would be as a military, political or counterterrorism analyst. I would also love to have something to do with space but my educational background does not intersect which is okay. 

What do you think that my odds are of getting into the intelligence community with no experience, no internship but a education heavily focused on international affairs as of right now? I understand that my chances are probably low as of now but are they 0%?

I have applied to, as of now, three private companies that do intelligence work. My expectations are low given that I do not have a security clearance or experience but I wanted to apply anyhow while I am sitting here waiting to hear back from schools. 

What words of advice would you give me for now while I am sitting here waiting to hear back from Grad schools? Apply for internships now? Apply to the three letter agencies or private companies now?

I'm kind of sitting here in limbo, not going all in on applying for jobs just in case I get into Grad School. I don't want to say I'm lost but I am anxious of what lies next. 

Thanks for any advice or input in advance! Any at all will help!",pkb954,Intelligence
"[Question] what would be the implications if the Trump campaign used Israel's Intel from their JCPOA sabotage campaign? If Israel gave data to Cambridge wikileaks Russia UAE and Saudi, hiw would the US handle this?","I came across a lot if information on Israel's dislike of Obama and the shift in middle eastern policy by working with Iran even though Israel did not want that. Given Israel's finger prints on everything and finding out Black cube and other Israeli state Intel backed private companies going aftet Obama Kerry and other key JCPOA diplomats, it leads me to believe they are a big source of republican drive in congress and Trumps presidency. 

Whats the likelihood of this? How does the US go about handling this? Is it treason and espionage to use an allied country to do this?

Intelligence/Black Op sites that go ‘above’ presidential authorization,"Something I could never understand is that, if these project sites are real, and these sites are not responding to the a President/FBI Director/etc why don’t they (president/etc) just order a raid on the sites and stop the money flowing in to them?

Surely if the IRS audited these so-called ‘black budgets’ they WOULD find where the money is going and where it’s coming from.. this doesn’t even seem hard cause how these alleged ‘top secret’ sites work seem to go wayyy beyond their authority.﻿

I’m not talking about normal ‘top secret’ things, but like when you hear really outlandish claims like some site reverse engineering ‘alien’ technology or some other site doing ‘mind control’ research.. why can’t that stuff simply be shut down?

I used to be smart,"Hey!

I’m a first year physics major in uni (going into second year).

I used to be a smart kid, then again elementary school and grade 9-10 were easy- I could get away without studying.

I don’t know what happened when I hit grade 11. For some reason I struggled more to do well, even if I put in the time to study. I did come out with the same average have had in grades 9 and 10, but I didn’t feel like I learned anything. My OCD got extremely bad that year too . Grade 12 was the same, my ocd was horrible and my brain didn’t really do its thing until second term with calculus. 
Calculus actually made me feel smart, the proofs made so much sense for me, I could prove them etc. I guess that gave me confidence cause I was able to up my marks in my other courses as well. 

Then first year of uni hit, first term was amazing. I didn’t do extraordinarily (I ended off with a C+ in linear algebra - my fault, had an AWFUL professor and couldn’t find the time to study it on my own - we didn’t have a textbook for the course either), but physics concepts just clicked right away. Second term wasn’t so good. It stared off nice, I was getting As in all of my courses but physics didn’t make sense  until the very last week of the term (granted it was related to a topic my teacher skipped in hs ) and my As in the other three courses fell to Bs. 

I used to be a smart kid, my teachers liked me, I used to stand out and now I don’t any more, I don’t know why. 

I can’t tell if my ocd is holding back or maybe I’m not trying hard enough? Or maybe I’m too distracted when I’m studying? 

I don’t know.

Intel on Iraq War 2003 and the Coalition Provisional Authority needed,"Dear r/Intelligence reader,

I hope I don’t break any rules by this entry asking for information. If this is the case please let me know and I will alter/delete this post. 

I am a student working on my BA thesis. My thesis is on the Iraq War of 2003. The research question focuses on the decisions made by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) regarding the de-Ba’athefication of Iraq and the disbanding of the Iraqi army. 

These decisions disregarded most if not all input from people working on the ground in the first few weeks of the occupation. I am trying to compile books, articles, reports and other intel to further explain the policy of the CPA. 

My question for you is: are there any sources I should definitively read/watch? I am also interested in the run up to the War and the DoD its role in this. 

When I complete my thesis I will post a summary of my findings to this sub if anyone is interested! 

Thanks in advance ",throwawaysofardamn,Intelligence

Need Advice for Graduate Programs in Intelligence,"I’ve investigated several different graduate degree programs and am trying do decide which program or type of program to pursue to best prepare me for a career in intelligence. I’ve applied to a [Johns Hopkins program](http://advanced.jhu.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/geospatial-intelligence/degree-requirements/) in geospatial intelligence, a [Georgetown program](https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/423/master-of-professional-studies-in-applied-intelligence/) in Applied Intelligence &amp; Cyber Intelligence, and a [USF Florida program](http://www.grad.usf.edu/programs/programinfomation.php?pcode=ILSASSGIM.S.) that focuses more on information science-based analysis and some cyber intelligence.

The USF one is interesting in that it doesn’t focus on international relations as the foundation for intelligence studies. Their website touts that the program is built around an innovative STEM-based model for professional analytic education that is grounded in the broader discipline of information studies/science and focuses primarily on developing analytic competencies, blending strategy with informatics. USF also offers a cyber intelligence concentration in the program.

I’m interested in all of them, so my I would love some advice on which program will better prepare me to work in intelligence — geospatial, cyber, or information science?",mnycat,Intelligence

Science Weapons and Technology Analyst,"I received an offer from an agency for an overt position as technology analyst (weapons). I'm currently in tech (compsci), and the job pays about the same, well a little less, than my private industry gig. I need to figure out if I want to take it. 

My biggest concerns are what to do after this job (what kind of positions do people typically move into after something like this) and, also, I'm concerned that my technical skills (i.e. coding) will degrade. This is research, I think, and I do development. 

Any thoughts?",CindyCalled,Intelligence
Private Intelligence Job.,"Hello all,

A bit of background. I was a former intelligence analyst for a military branch for 6 years. It was mainly a Niche duty slot I got put into. Anyways, I have performed all source intelligence plus the Niche job for 6 years. I recently got in contact with a company (SVOB) that specializes in threat mitigation. They offered a high paying contract as an analyst in my niche for a few years with a 3 month on 1 month off schedule, all accommodations paid for. 
Obviously, I have heard of these types of agencies before and they are very lucrative, but I have never dealt with them, and they seem to rely on money that isn’t necessarily designated for their mission set. My main question is, what is the major risk of working for one of these companies? And before you ask, no this is not a DOD or otherwise normally funded contract and I’m not quite sure they are completely (definitely partially funded) funded by the USG. 

Thanks.",miffed_analyst,Intelligence

I'm most interested in the Technical Targeting Analyst / Targeting Officer positions, but I'd like to know more about them. Any ideas as to where can I learn more about day-to-day life in those jobs? Or find other possible career paths for the &gt;35 with a graduate degree in science? And how important is fluency in another language? I only have basic knowledge of 2 other languages.

"“Tip of The Iceberg” – The Pending Intelligence Memo is The Beginning, Not The End…","The text is from Rep. Mark Meadows' [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/RepMarkMeadows/status/959286220969754630).

&gt;I know we live in a hyper-partisan environment, and I know it can be easy to disregard any inquiry like this as party politics. I understand that. But this is so far above politics, folks. Lady Justice wears a blindfold. Her scale is supposed to be balanced.

&gt;If any Department of Justice, Republican or Democrat, put their thumb on the scale for the sake of politics–it would undermine the very fabric of who we are as a nation. Americans deserve the truth, one way or the other.

&gt;Last point: If you remember anything from this news cycle, remember: your right as an American to privacy from your government spying on you is critical. It is foundational to who we are as a Republic. Never take that right for granted, no matter the political party you belong to.

This [article](https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/02/02/tip-of-the-iceberg-the-pending-intelligence-memo-is-the-beginning-not-the-end/) discusses the question and allegation that the DOJ has taken on an air of unaccountable corruption and makes the point that these agencies are answerable to congressional oversight.

*[I]t doesn’t come as a surprise when the epicenter of that attitude in Washington DC balks at the concept of having oversight, and thumbs their nose at congress by refusing to turn over the underlying FISA application documents.*

*The House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Devin Nunes, has oversight over the entire intelligence apparatus, including DOJ/FBI counterintelligence and the FISA Courts.  The House Judiciary Committee, Chairman Bob Goodlatte, has statutory oversight over the entire Department of Justice.  The Senate Judiciary Committee, Chairman Chuck Grassley, has oversight over the federal court processes used by the U.S. Department of Justice.   The Office of Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, is the internal DOJ watchdog.*

Hopefully, most here agree with the position that Congress does have real oversight powers and responsibilities, not just formal and empty ones.",avengingturnip,Intelligence

Finding a Location Via the Data in the Photo. Just a Hobby of Mine.,"I have this hobby where I located places via info in the photographs. This may be of interest if you want to sharpen your deductive reasoning and search skills. I have confirmed the locations with the Owners of the Photographs given.   

My locating method mostly notes: 
 *  Building
 *  Wording/Language in view
 *  Fauna/Flora 
 *  Direction of Photograph (North South East West)


The filming location for [Elementary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/elementary/comments/5tco00/how_i_found_the_filming_location_for_the_roof/)

#[Picture Given.](http://i.imgur.com/3x4h0a1.jpg) 

#[Standardized Map, for the Locations of the Markers Above.](http://i.imgur.com/YM5wB2y.jpg)

1.	We know that the Show takes place in New York City, So that is a given
2.	From the Buildings in the back ground listed left to right:
 * 	Empire state building in Green
 *	Chrysler Building in White
 *	Citi-Group Center
 *	432 Park Ave.

 	With these building in this order, we are able to say that the East River in full View of the Camera.  There are 10 Bridges that Span the East River. 

 * Brooklyn Bridge

 * Manhattan Bridge

 * Williamsburg Bridge

 * Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge

 * Roosevelt Island Bridge

 * Triborough Bridge (Suspension Bridge)

 * Hell Gate Bridge

 * Rikers Island Bridge

 * Bronx–Whitestone Bridge

 * Throgs Neck Bridge


We can see that there are two shore lines when looking at the picture. Meaning that there is an Island in the river. Only One of the aforementioned Bridges span the width of the East River and Crosses an Island.  The Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge.  

So now we Know that we are looking At Manhattan from Queens. While being South of the Queensboro Bridge.

3.	Take note of the Roof Architecture of the Building Holmes and Watson are on.  The Roof line is not built on a 90° corner. The Majority of “Brownstone” Residential building were built from the years 1868 into the 1890s.   Not with 100% certainty I can say that most Brownstone Style Residential Building were built using 90° corners.  With this being said, the building they are on is not a residential building. Or at least the one we see them enter.

4.	We can Use Satellite Imagery Now that we know The Building is in Queens and is South of the Queensboro Bridge.
 * 	Note that the building’s roof has doors on the South side with one needed Stairs, This is not entirely unique but would aid in the viewing form great heights. 
 * 	We find ourselves at   10-10 44th Ave, Long Island City, NY 11101 Which is the Roof Used in Elementary that gives us the Iconic and Beautiful View of New York.

A scooter in [Vietnam](https://www.reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/7cm8q5/scooters_are_kind_of_a_big_thing_here/dprm7de/?context=3)

Green Garage floors, Most likely somewhere in Asia, Probably not Japan, As I saw more concrete floors, and white paint in Japan not green.   Old Man Sitting on a Plastic Chair... no help there.   

There are a few views of a License tags, I know that Philippines does not have [square motorcycle tags](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Motorcycle_PHI.jpg/220px-Motorcycle_PHI.jpg).   Thailand has [script on the tag](http://d2ydh70d4b5xgv.cloudfront.net/images/8/8/rare-number-original-thailand-license-plate-number-motorcycle-no-232-bangkok-351b770c4c5a477b6ff2da4c27c405b5.jpg), as does [Korea](http://www.licenseplatemania.com/fotos/zuidkorea/zuidkorea39.jpg).  Where as this is just numbers with European Lettering.  With a Designation of 59-M2 on the top I know they may use Euro Alphabet as a base for official documents. (So possibly European colonization at some point)   That does not help.  Since 40% of Indochina was controlled by the Spanish Dutch French and British as some point in time

These scooters are clean, not muddy or beaten to hell, some have sport bike style suspension.  So most likely this is not a rural area, this is a city with smooth paved roads.

Now with all this in mind, The Designation on the top left hand corner of the tag is most likely a regional code.  After a quick look at Vietnamese Regional License Plate code I find that 41/50-59 are Reserved for one region,  Highly populated. 


#Ok.  Final Verdict here is that this picture was most likely taken in HO-CHI MIN city Vietnam

The first thing I noticed is that you are offset by apx 45 degrees from the buildings in the back ground.  while the grey building across the street is parallel with you. 

Next I noticed the red lights at the top of the netting structure. These lights are on horizontal structure and are not found on roads or highways, the only area I can think of for that [horizontal  structure would be a train or metro system power delivery for electric cable suspension.](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/20/nyregion/TRAIN/TRAIN-master1050.jpg) 

There seems to be a road to your far left, meaning that this block can only have a handful of building at the most.  Small block. 

Most notable is the [Citibank building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sterling+Blooms/@40.7446849,-73.9400945,507a,35y,302.71h,44.8t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258d873b3f8ed:0xa877259d01a5f7ef!8m2!3d40.7508481!4d-73.9492997) in the very middle of your photo.  Some of the building to its side are fairly new (the one the top 15 floor with the lights off has not even finished construction.

With all of this I think I can [locate your view point to somewhere in this red circle.](https://i.imgur.com/MUhjz7R.jpg)

First I would note the language on the bikes, German, fairly narrows it down to 4 Countries.  Then the Building, Saturn (a Food company in Europe, a defunct auto company in the US) Fit X work out center, and lastly the Holiday Inn. You can also see on a street sign in the background that Hamburg and Frankfurt are opposing directions, So now I Narrow my search to the largest cities between the Hamburg and Frankfurt. Berlin sticks out like a swore thumb. from there its all about narrowing down the location of the three aforementioned shops.  The Berliner Congress Center, Alexanderstraße 11, 10178 Berlin, Germany.   [within the red circle?](https://i.imgur.com/7JpEdaG.jpg)
It was a little difficult to locate since the [Saturn building Holiday Inn and Fit X are new there.](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.5208526,13.4158904,3a,75y,281.38h,101.89t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOGPDvySFJsNdiK-r-mLli6oWUAGhEUpJTBnFs8!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOGPDvySFJsNdiK-r-mLli6oWUAGhEUpJTBnFs8%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya213.44624-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352)

Well, we wrapped det [detonator] cord around their necks and wired them to the detonator box. And basically what it did was blow their heads off. The interrogator would tell the translator, usually a South Vietnamese intelligence officer, 'Ask him this.' He'd ask him, 'Who gave you the gun?' And the guy would start to answe, or maybe he wouldn't-maybe he'd resist-but the general idea was to waste the first two. They planned the snatches that way. Pick up this guy because we're pretty sure he's VC cadre-these other two guys just run errands for him.

"""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" - Book review in Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists. It's about how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions &amp; Trillions of tax dollars given to ""Defense"" industry","""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly overstating Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

Paul C. Warnke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., was director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and chief arms negotiator in the Carter administration, and assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs in the Johnson administration.

Currently, I work in the loss prevention sector as an analyst (financial loss and internal retail crimes). My educational background is Law &amp; Politics and MCs in Communications. I have the opportunity to move to a role as a Threat intelligence analyst, however, that field is quite unfamiliar to me. What are the options for possible next steps after this role? I’m not that interested in the classical business continuity roles.

another career change question,"Hey all,
I realize this isn't really normal for this sub, but a thread here from a few days ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/Intelligence/comments/7mpes4/too_late_for_a_career_change) made me think it might be worth asking you all a question. The short version is: does anyone have any advice for getting into a career in geopolitical intelligence/sociocultural analysis but outside of government? Is such a thing even possible without some prior IC experience?

The longer version is this: given my academic background (I've got advanced degrees in regional studies and a knack for languages), friends and family often joke that I should get a job with the CIA. I'm looking for a career change and considered that, but, having looked into it pretty thoroughly, I'm fairly certain that my drug history (and maybe my heavy drinking and foreign travel) will keep me from getting a security clearance (at least for a couple years). That being the case, I was wondering if anyone here knew of career paths that would call for the same qualifications (the aforementioned degrees and languages) but wouldn't require a clearance. I'm assuming that private industry is where to go to get around the clearance issue (if anywhere), but, the opportunities that come up when I use intelligence as a search term on LinkedIn and Glassdoor are usually business intelligence openings that require quantitative skills. Does anyone here have ideas about other career moves I could make?",mismanaged29,Intelligence

Too late for a career change?,"Hello everyone,

I'm not certain how often this sub gets these questions but I honestly don't know where else to start, and would appreciate any help. 

I love intelligence, counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism ops, espionage, cybercrime &amp; cyber security. Anything that can remotely come even close to the subject of intelligence interests me. I've been fascinated with this since 2008, but only just realized recently that this is what I want to do.

Unfortunately, I'm already in a program for a BA in theatre, and I have two semesters left for that. Originally I was worried that no one would really want that degree involved, however there are some parts of the DIA &amp; NSA that have jobs as ""information collectors"" that do say they want theatre experience. 

The point is, I'm asking whether or not I should go back into University for a second bachelor's in something that'll help me more in pursuit of what I want to do. That option seems intense and would require a major financial &amp; time sacrifice. I have no problem with that but was wondering what you guys think about it. 
I'm already taking courses to test and get certified in both parts the CompTIA+ exam, as well as CompTIA security+. I'm also training to take the CCNA200-125 &amp; CCNA Security210-260. 

I can also pursue an associate's of science in that direction as well, which would definitely be not as demanding as a whole new undergrad degree. 

What do you guys think? Have any of you had any experience or know anyone that does? Thank you all very much.",SharifAlFaruqi96,Intelligence

For Someone Interested I’m Working in Intelligence,"Hope this is relevant for this thread-if not, but you know where it might be, my interest is genuine and I’d really appreciate it

After a recent career change, I’ve been re-assessing my talents and life goals, which has led me to consider working in intelligence (primarily a talent match, it would appear). I’m very good at reading and writing-I scores a 35 in Reading Comprehension on the ACT at 17 without studying at all or trying particularly hard, and a 32 overall. I also scored 97 on the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test.

I’m interested in intel because:

1) I may be naturally gifted/suited for it
2) I want a relatively high income (($80k+) and the potential for work hours that allow me to train kids on the side (wrestling changed my life and it’s an area I really love to give back in)
3) My high school wrestling coach and longtime mentor has worked in intelligence for 30 years, and may be able to help me understand/start out

4) I’ve always wanted to join the military, and it may be a great place for me to learn/get started

If you care to read further, the link below gives an impression similar to how I see being an analyst as well as some further background on myself. To any who take the time to make suggestions or offer insight, it is greatly appreciated.


http://matthewburton.org/become-an-intelligence-analyst/

While math had always been my weakest subject, I still attended an engineering school known for it’s petroleum program and generally high attrition rate (and suicide rate, sadly) but like many peers on the wrestling team worked a semester in oilfield, decided I liked it, and changed my major. With 60 hours in Mechanical Engineering (and 2 grueling, debt-ridden and terribly boring years to go) I transferred to an online business program which I finished while in oilfield, working 70-80 hours per week. Still full time, maintained a 4.0-largely because the program focused on writing papers.

I became a field engineer upon graduation, where my talent was being smart enough to understand wellbore plans and communicate with engineers over the phone, and physically strong and likeable enough to lead a crew and interact with roughnecks and company men. I set a few ‘records’ for getting into certain schools, and even taught a portion of a class on doing wellbore surveys in difficult environments. Mostly I set those ‘records’ because the jobs I trained and broke out on were much harder but didn’t pay anymore. Some saw that as dumb but I enjoyed and am still proud of it.

A sibling became sick, I moved home near the end of the O&amp;G downturn, and became a high school math teacher and wrestling coach.

I’m considering joining the Air Force or Navy as 14nx, or 182x respectively (correct me if I am mistaken) but getting into a particular field, at least with the Air Force whose pipeline I joined 5 months ago, seems both slow and no guarantee. I may put in all that time and effort to become an officer and simply be put somewhere else.

I’m considering enlisting so I have more negotiating power 

A) More qualified, relatively speaking
B) Conditions are in my contract up front-none of the months/years getting into OCS, or inability to just wait until a slot I want opens up

The idea of earning a SEAL challenge contract, and requesting an intelligence MOS appeals to me. Again, appreciate any help.",morflegober,Intelligence

"With infinite typewriters, typists, and time, some of them produce classified information. What are the consequences?","This felt a little too niche for /r/showerthoughts but that's basically how this started:

You've probably heard the idea that ""Infinite monkeys at infinite typewriters could write Shakespeare"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)

But what would happen if they conjured a top secret document?

Obviously the nature of this idea puts the information amidst a sea of gibberish and passages that may *look* like an important leak but have no basis in reality. But despite that, what could publishing a trove of ""Infinite Typewriter"" output to the internet mean for national security officials?

This seems kind of silly, but with machine-learning bots spitting out text articles it feels like it's much closer to reality than it should be.

I feel like it puts everyone, from the people trying to protect that information to people who could exploit the information in a bizarre position. If you try to take the information down or reprimand the person posting it, then you're basically confirming that some part of it is true and worth suppressing. 

On the other hand, if you see something that looks like an intelligence leak that comes out of this gibberish document, you have no reason to guess that it would be true or have any bearing on actual classified information, even if the information happened to be identical.

Are there any similar thought experiments or cases that might affect how something like this would/could be handled? 
(Not sure if this is the *right* sub for this kind of thing, but seems like the sub most likely to be interested, sorry to be weird.)

I have six years of experience in the Navy Reserves and my clearance is fully expected to be renewed. 

My biggest hold up is which degree to pursue. My strength is overwhelmingly anything geo-politics and earth sciences, so I'm thinking a BS in geography or even history. I realize experience is probably the biggest factor here, but I'm looking to enhance what I have with additional education.

Ideally, I'd like to avoid the DC area for personal reasons, but I'm open to what works best.

"Answers to Bagley's ""Twenty Unavoidable Questions About The Nosenko Case"", as evident from the recently declassified report"," The most interesting (to me) information in a recent release of JFK Files were the reports on Nosenko's case, which were referred to a lot by many insiders writing on the subject, but were made available only recently. So here I'd post some of my thoughts on Bagley's questions, as probed by his report:

1. Nosenko claimed that through the entire years 1960-61 he was deputy chief of the American-Embassy section of the American department [...] Why, during that period, was Nosenko performing low-level tasks for the Tourist department, as he himself described and as was independently confirmed in at least one case?

 A) Nosenko never really wanted to work in US Embassy section; he resisted the move; he managed a relatively small group within a department. His ""deputy"" credentials cannot really be translated into English, and in practice meant that he could sign certain documents while his boss was away.

b) Why did KGB insiders, including one former member of that section and Oleg Kalugin, later deny that he ever held that position? 

 A) Golitsyn confirmed that he had that position, as Golitsyn himself was working directly with Nosenko's subordinate. If you suspect that Nosenko never worked, then Golitsyn must have lied as well.

2. How and why did Nosenko preserve and bring to Geneva in 1964 his KGB authorization for travel, in December 1963, to search for the fleeing KGB officer Cherepanov? 

 A) Nosenko preserved his authorization to show his credentials, as most official KGB docs were taken away prior to the visit. The ""authorization"" as it appears on file is really a relatively minor document mostly used for accounting and service provision, as the trip didn't involve any restricted areas.

2b) Why was the authorization (signed by the SCD chief Gribanov) made out to “Lt. Col. Nosenko”, a rank which he had claimed to CIA, whereas under detailed questioning he admitted he was only being a captain? 

 A) OK, here it gets complicated. 

 Nosenko's progression, as originally claimed, was actually quite logical: he was promoted from junior lieutenant (one small star) to captain (four small stars) over his career as a technical specialist, got promoted to major (one large star) when he was in US section, and then got promoted to lieutenant colonel (two large stars) when he became the head of US tourist section; this is actually in line with what would expect in such roles. However, what Nosenko later recalled is that his scheduled promotion from senior lieutenant (three small stars) to captain (four small stars) was denied in 1956 over the STD incident; when he joined US section, he was promised a promotion to major skipping the rank of captain altogether, but this never happened due to clerical error, and he actually remained a captain while occupying a major's position. When he was moved backed to Tourist department, he was supposed to get another promotion, again, skipping the rank of a major (one big star) to lieutenant colonel (two big stars), but was not sure whether it happened, and whether he got any promotion, since his official rank was kept in his file he had only restricted access to. The statement prepared for Nosenko to sign by Russian subordinates of Bagley reduced this to ""I lied about my rank"", while the doc actually supports Nosenko's presumption that he was in fact promoted to lieutenant colonel as promised.

 3) Why was Nosenko ignorant of the operational mission to Helsinki of his direct subordinate Kosolapov, as part of an operation to recruit an American Embassy cipher clerk?

 It's a very good question, and it looks like Kosolapov covered his stuff up here. I'll write a different post about it if this one is in demand.

4) . Why did Nosenko fail to tell CIA in 1962 about his surveillants’ recent spotting of American Embassy Security Officer Abidian visiting Penkovsky’s dead drop?

5) Why, in 1964, did Nosenko err by a full year – in a manner directly contradicting his career story — about the date of Abidian’s visit to that dead drop?

 The CIA's internal investigation suspected that Nosenko confused the dead drop on Pushkin street that was exposed in 1962 with a dead drop on another street two years prior, which resolves this contradiction.

10). Was Nosenko really in Geneva in 1962 and 1964 as the security watchdog of a Soviet conference delegation, as he claimed, contrary to expert testimony and contrary to later statements by his KGB bosses? 

 Interestingly enough, Bagley himself rejects these later statements as disinformation, yet includes them here.

11) How does one explain Nosenko’s many changes of stories about his KGB career, even his date of entry, and the later evidence that the stories were false?

 Nosenko had much less ""changes of stories"" about his career than Bagley lets us believe; his only meaningful one is the merging of his service in GRU in 1952 with KGB, which was explained by trying to avoid the question of how Nosenko managed to join KGB after being rejected once

12) How does one explain Nosenko’s inability (or unwillingness?) to describe even the most routine KGB procedures? 

 Here we have to go into Deryabin's persona: Deryabin was responsible for guards department and counterintelligence within Soviet military at the peak Stalin times, while Nosenko was responsible for honey traps for foreign agents when there was active de-Stalinization. Deryabin extrapolated the former onto the latter, and created a theory of his own that stated that Nosenko was an ex-convict who never worked for KGB - which contradicted literally dozens of other sources, Golitsyn included - which is one big reason why Deryabin's conclusions on Nosenko's knowledge of KGB were taken with a big grain of salt after review. 

14) Is it true, as Nosenko highlighted to CIA in 1962, that the KGB first uncovered Pyotr Popov, CIA’s great spy in the GRU (Soviet Military Intelligence), by chance surveillance of an American diplomat mailing a letter in Moscow in late January 1959?

 This was later confirmed by KGB accounts; however, by the logic of Nosenko's penetration theory, it is inconclusive. 

15) Did Nosenko really have his claimed inside knowledge about Lee Harvey Oswald in the Soviet Union – despite later contradiction by a KGB chairman and other KGB veterans including Oleg Kalugin?

 It looks like both. Nosenko had access to a relatively small amount of information, while the fuller file on Oswald was maintained by Belorussian republican KGB, which would not report this to Nosenko unless asked specifically, as it was an independent organization.

16) Did the KGB recruit in Moscow any American Embassy code clerk prior to Nosenko’s defection? If so, how does one explain Nosenko’s authoritative claim to the contrary?

 The answer to this question, obviously, is ""If not, then Nosenko told the truth""; you really can't build an argument on a contradiction to the fact that is not known.

17) How does one explain that this ten-year KGB CI operations officer was unable to disclose to the U.S. a single KGB spy who at the time of uncovering, a) was still active and b) had current access to US or NATO-country official secrets and c) had previously been unsuspected by Western counterintelligence? 

 Nosenko always worked in a department which dealt with foreigners in the USSR; regardless, he was able to provide info on several people who were still active in the West, even if they were not as good as Bagley would have wanted.",SamsonFox,Intelligence

Intelligence Officer Disqualifier?,"Hello

I smoked weed a little over 10 months ago and had a really bad reaction to it. It was my first and only time ever using it, and marijuana is legal in the state that I live and used it in.

When I smoked, the weed caused me to be paranoid and anxious, and I thought I was dying. I called an ambulance and went to the ER.

The paranoia and anxiety continued after that the weed wore off. One day a few months later, I was afraid for my life and told my parents. They didn't know what to do so they consulted their doctor friend, and basically they suggested that I go to the ER again.

That night I was admitted to psychiatric facility and stayed for two weeks. (In hindsight this only made the situation much worse)

I wasn't hospitalized for rehab for drug use, it was because of my anxious and paranoid reaction to the weed.

I wasn't diagnosed in the hospital, but when I got out, I was misdiagnosed as bipolar.

I have been in therapy since the hospitalization and have also learned that I'm not actually bipolar.

I know that most agencies look past the marijuana usage after a certain amount of time has passed. Will the hospitalization disqualify me from working as an intelligence officer in an intelligence agency? 
Is there a certain amount time I should let go by before I apply?",BLuue42,Intelligence

Mossad Attacks!,"The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. I always recall this outstanding quotation from the iconic movie, when I face another amazingly naive statement that Mossad allegedly operated hard against the Soviet Union and nowadays it doesn't operate against Russia. The Israeli information warfare pros still work perfectly, if they've managed to hammer such a delirious thought into so many heads.  
  
Actually, Mossad always avoided involving local Jews into the field work to get rid of the outbreaks of anti-Semitic unrests, if it failed. However, it entirely doesn't mean that Israel didn't spy on the USSR and doesn't spy on Russia. The case is the non-Semitic agents are recruited. Just take a thought how Mossad could let go out of sight the USSR which was supplying arms to Arabs – the mortal enemies of the Israeli state!  
  
Nowadays, Russia stands together with Iran in Syria, actively transforming for its own benefit the geopolitical map of the world. Until the war began in 2011, Iran couldn't directly threaten the Israeli borders, because it had neither a common frontier, nor access to the Mediterranean. By the present autumn of 2017 the units of the IRGC, supported by some armed groups of the pro-Iranian Shia movement Hezbollah, almost approached the Israeli border. I hope I don't need to explain what kind of concern it causes in Tel Aviv. Indeed, Iranians don't want to stop and they're looking to break on through to the Mediterranean. There's a great opportunity to observe at anchorage near the naval supply &amp; maintenance base in Tartus not only a Russian squadron, but also an Iranian one. Keeping in mind Tehran's geopolitical plans about Houthis Yemen, where local Shias boldly destroy expensive Western military hardware with Saudi staff inside, the situation goes really dangerous for Israel.  
  
By all means, the Israeli aren't going not to do a hand's turn. September 12 a Bulgarian website Novinite referred to the Chinese Xinhua News Agency claiming that the Israeli Air Force were holding large-scale exercises in Bulgaria. According to Novinite, the Israeli part was represented at the exercises by 42 aircraft including the F-15 Eagle &amp; F-16 Fighting Falcon. Bulgaria took a part in the exercises with the Fulcrum jet fighter aircrafts and land-based anti-aircraft systems including the SA-10 Grumble. The exercises in Bulgaria were a part of wide-scale Israeli exercises which are usually held twice a year. Curiously, these exercises have become the largest for the last 19 years. Save the ground and air force units, the Israeli Military Intelligence &amp; Navy also participated in the exercises. It was noted in the article, the distance between Israel &amp; Bulgaria approximately corresponded to the distance from Israel to the central regions of Iran, and IRIAF and Iranian Air Defense Force were armed with the Fulcrum and the SA-10 Grumble systems. Obviously, a strike on the territory of Iran was trained during the exercises.  
  
It stands to reason, an operation like this is impossible to be planned without Mossad's participation. You would ask me, what does Russia have to do with this? I can explain – some indirect evidence says, the SA-10 Grumble system has been hacked by Mossad's agents for a long time. The episode in Bulgaria wasn't ""the first meeting"" of the IAF and SA-10 Grumble, but it actually was a neutralization (disposal) exercise of that SAM. There's no fool in Tehran, who wouldn't understand it. The only hope for Iran not to receive a smashing strike is the integration into Russian modern layered air-defense. The Iranians won't have got access to this security umbrella before they completely enter into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation next year. Who will say now that Mossad doesn't intensify its efforts on the Russian direction? The hunting for the secrets of SA-21 Growler and SA-22 Greyhound, the attempts to recruit agents – our Israeli friends have no end of work.",GHiguchi,Intelligence

The legitimacy of this Sub-Reddit and its Mods,"I originally came here in hopes to closer follow the story which involved the suspected Russian influence on this previous presidential election, as well as a general interest in espionage, foreign relations, active measures, etc. However, it didn't take long to find out the Mods who run this sub-reddit were not only extremely biased, but shockingly ignorant in the realm of intelligence. 

I'm not going to expand on specifics that involve any personal details about these moderators, but I will give a general overview. 

The creator and the mods, in my opinion, can be placed on the far-right end of the spectrum. I would not call them extremists in any manner, but you are dealing with doomsday prepping, soothsayers. In everything I've gathered about them, it also appears they have little to no background in Intelligence, or anything that orbits the craft. 

If you're looking for an example that sums up how inept their grasp is, look no further [than this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intelligence/comments/3tlf17/the_growing_division_between_rintelligence_and/?st=j87m55yl&amp;sh=4ddc39dd) 

In essence, if you're looking for a well rounded, expansive and perceptive conversation on ""Intelligence"", you've come to the wrong place. I expect this thread to be removed shortly and myself banned, so please PM me for any further conversation.

On a side note, the more interesting moderator of this subreddit, _zorch_, appears to have been removed, along with his account being completely scrubbed. If anyone can give me an explanation to this, I'd be very grateful.

Equifax Hack Questions,"Regarding this hack, I have some serous concerns and questions.  

First, I have to note that [it is not isolated](http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-b2b-breach-trifecta-equifax-sec-and-deloitte/).
 The entire US financial system is under attack- the SEC, Deloitte, as well as Equifax, and I think it's safe to presume that these are merely the three biggest, and there must be numerous other smaller entities dealing with similar attacks, as the [Sonic hack](http://fortune.com/2017/09/27/sonic-stock-credit-card-data-breach/) demonstrates.  

**The implications of the Equifax Hack itself**


1.  This is the biggest breach of US financial integrity of all time.  One shudders in fear knowing that 200M+ individuals' financial interests have been compromised.


2.  So far, the identity of the hackers is undetermined, or at least not reported.  But Equifax has announced that they hired Mandiant to investigate.  Given Mandiant's history in investigating state-sponsored cyber-attacks, is it safe to presume that Equifax management thinks that is likely?  The FBI is also investigating, and presumably others as well, given the scope of this attack.


3.  If this was state-sponsored, then by whom?  China and Russia are the obvious suspects.  The political ramifications of either one being named would be enormous.  If China, trade may see a massive shock.  If Russia, then the continuing political fallout for the party in power will worsen dramatically.


4.  What is the danger we're facing?  Given the enormity of the breach, I have two main concerns:

4a.  This data could be used for a variety of purposes.  On the low-risk side, it could be mined for relatively standard corporate espionage purposes for the sake of enriching state-controlled market players, albeit at a grander scale than ever before.  The more apocalyptic notion, though, is that this data could be utilized as a whole in a single massive attack, wiping out personal wealth and debt assets alike, destabilizing the entire public's faith in the US financial system, a digital Pearl Harbor not unlike the type of destruction envisioned in *Fight Club.*  When the average people can't eat, can't keep a roof above their heads, then we have to worry about pitchforks and crazed mobs.

4b.  A more insidious notion: with all this data breached, every single government official--military, elected, or civil servant--has been compromised and made vulnerable to blackmail.  For instance, every politician in gov't who ever bought a hotel room with a credit card his wife didn't know about, for the sake of enjoying the company of another woman, could be blackmailed with this info.  No telling whom this implicates, but one must assume that everyone is vulnerable.


**What if the SEC/Equifax/Deloitte breaches are connected?**

5.  If these are connected, then a state actor is surely the most logical conclusion (see 3).


6.  This would also point to a grander plan of using this data to destabilize the US's primacy in world finance.


7.  This seems to be an act of cyber warfare.  What is a viable US response in the case of a state actor's involvement?  Respond in kind?  Surely there's no other nation with this kind and amount of valuable data, so that would probably fall flat.  This leads to the dangerous conclusion that hot war may be the logical follow-up to any serious utilization of this data.


8.  Are other vital systems equally at risk?  For instance, the Navy is investigating whether the recent ship crashes may have been caused by GPS-spoofing.  Are we more vulnerable than we think to a serious attack, possibly without the ability to effectively respond?


Note- all financial regulatory bodies are exempt from FOIA (see exemption 8 of FOIA.)  Given the ramifications and potential fallout of these attacks, will we see pressure on the regulatory bodies to hand over data that the financial services corporations would prefer kept undisclosed?  Will this trigger further public scrutiny, pitting vested financial entities against their clients and citizens, and to what degree?",reptiliansentinel,Intelligence

I am a high school graduate wanting to find a career.,"Before I say anything else, I am not some regular casual kid who has seen movies and wants in on the ""action"", like James Bond of whatever crap that is. Mainstream, basically.

At first, I was thinking of going to college for a career path to the CIA. The agency's ideas and objectives interest me, including the aspect of studying other countries' governments and how everyone maintains world security. ""Spying"" does occur, but mostly just to keep tabs and not to prevent some huge one-eyed evil villain from taking over the world. I am definitely a realist and I would like to see how global politics work on a, well..global scale. 

However, another intel branch caught my eye. That is the Defense Intelligence Agency. I started thinking about this specific agency more and more. I am more inclined to think this would be my desired destination. 

What piqued my interest here was the fact that the DIA focuses solely on military subjects of other countries. I am a history buff and love learning about armies and military might, especially the Romans and Spartans, etc. It sounds like it would be a first-line-of-defense against other hostile countries, such as incoming (God forbid) nuke-carrying submarines and planes. I sort of got this from the fact that the DIA was formed under Kennedy during Cold War times against the Ruskies. 

From what I have gathered so far, the DIA is somewhat like the DoD counterpart to the CIA, although apparently only around 30% of personnel are actually active military, probably on-loan so to speak?

..Which brings me to my question. If I wanted to go into something based around that area (word politics, government, etc.?) in an intelligence format..Should I go into Army or Navy intel and spend some time there first, to gain experience that would help me later on? Or should I apply to college and work a degree straight into wherever I want?

P.S. I make good grades and the college process wouldn't be a problem, other than location. I am in South Carolina. Also, which major would be best to get into a military intel AoC? I am pretty sure it's going to have to be STEM. What area of major study should I be researching and applying to in order to have both good chances of getting in AND having a worthwhile experience that I could use later? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Careers at intersection of political science & netsec,"I'm looking for a bit of help brainstorming on career paths that fit my experience & interests. I hope this type of post isn't too self-indulgent, I figured the discussion generated could be useful to others with similar interests.

My IT background in point form below:

* self taught programmer from early teens
* no university degree
* 1 year technical school programming certificate that I got quite a while ago. It was much more breadth than depth and covered a lot of ground I had already self-taught. Exposed me to a few things I probably wouldn't have taken an interest in on my own but overall fairly disappointing course. The feeling I got was much more that they were interested in getting students to sign up (and pay) than making sure they had a skill set ready for the job market.
* never worked in an actual programmer / dev role professionally. Have continued to develop small things on my own time. Python is the tool of choice.
* worked my way up the path of internal QA dept. -> Helpdesk -> sysadmin
* More comfortable with Linux sysadmin than Windows but can work my through either with time & docs
* Strong interest in security for several years, particularly the offensive side. Work on vulnerable VMs, CTF challenges, etc... Jack of all trades in this area. Competent in web application attacks, understand assembly, concepts of binaries and memory layout, can work gdb / OllyDbg / windbg / IDA / radare, able to identify & write exploits for basic vulnerabilities in binary executables, nmap, metasploit, etc...  Spent a good bit of time in the OSCP labs.  Did not complete the test due to real life / time issues but feel it's fully within my capacity technically and plan to get back at it.

Career wise I'm getting pretty worn out doing day to day sysadmin / operational support in the commercial sector. I'll always be fascinated by the tech and will always be ready to learn technical stuff on my own, but I'm burning out on being situations where I'm having to get up to speed super fast on something I'm not that familiar with because of a last minute need from a production team. Or scheduling / executing maintenances amongst production teams who all insist any interruption at any hour of the day is disastrous for their timeline.

Not necessarily a good headspace with which to keep a sysadmin career going.

In addition to the above IT stuff I have a strong interest in intelligence, internation relations, cyber security law & policy, jurisdiction, law enforcement, issues related to cyber crime & state sponsored hacking / espionage, open source intelligence gathering online, etc... I'm at a crossroads right now where I have the opportunity to make a change so I'm considering going to to do a Political Science degree to pursue my interests in these areas.

Any thoughts on roles that could benefit from the technical background while putting me more in that academic / policy / strategy space? I think I'm well suited to be that guy with a foot in both worlds, comfortable interacting with people and social issues as well as terminals.

The dream role I imagine for myself would be more in an R&D type situation where I can experiment with different security related technologies, analyze and report on trends in the areas of cyber attacks / crime, etc... All this while feeling like I'm making a positive impact on the world. I understand that in any job where they pay you there are deliverables and deadlines but the idea would be something more exploratory, less driven by the commercial end result.

</special_snowflake_story>

Have at it, happy to hear your thoughts.

"John Kennedy was going to severely cut the CIA's budget, had he been re-elected in '64","John Kennedy planned to severely cut the CIA's budget, had he been re-elected in '64. The brave Kennedy was going to try to eviscerate their budget, so they killed him. Academic researcher Lisa Pease gave a public speech about this; it's available on YouTube at the link below.

The following is the amazing presentation by Lisa Pease given at a conference devoted to the JFK assassination. If you want to know more about CIA Director Allen Dulles' ruthless right-hand man James Angleton, Lisa Pease is an incredible archives researcher who will astound you. She gave her talk at the conference in 2014, and you can see her 45-minute talk on YouTube under the title ""James Angleton and Lee Oswald"" at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTdKgH1HN5M

Pease mentions, among many other fascinating details, that Angleton and the CIA blackmailed F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover by showing Hoover a photo of Hoover and his gay lover Clyde Tolson having sex. No, it's not this picture of Hoover and Tolson lounging in beach chairs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hoover_%26_Tolson.jpg - Chuckle :-) Or try this link if the preceding link doesn't work: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hoover_&_Tolson.jpg

"What is the best way to enter the NSA/CIA? (Mostly considering Army entrance, but possibly civilian)","I have multiple questions that I have gained while looking into this:

1. Would an ROTC scholarship and then an MOS 35 officer be a good path to work in the NSA/CIA afterwards?

2. Would it help to get a BA in intelligence and BS in Computer science with the scholarship?

3. As well as attending officer school, what else would be appropriate to help in a future with the Intelligence Community (IC) in terms of study or otherwise?

4. Is it recommended to go ROTC, or should I instead enlist in a 35 series MOS after I earn a degree without a scholarship or becoming an officer?

Any other suggestions for paths to working in the IC would be helpful.

What Cold War Intrigue Can Tell Us About the Trump-Russia Inquiry,,SuccessfulOperation,Intelligence
"rumint: ""ALARM: Why is Donald Trump rallying with children? Important history""","Read this from the Intelligence perspective that BSA was created partly as a domestic defense measure against the semi-classified methods which the Nazis used to transform Germany from a democracy to war-ready military totalitarianism in a half-decade (summarized as ""Captive Youth"").

____
____

**Read the bold text** for the short version.
____

**After the election in 1933**, many things were done to take permanent control of Germany's people, but the most strategic move was gaining the minds of the nation's 8-14 y.o. children. 

They got to them with schoolyard rumors, popularity, and speeches, to the horror of many parents. After a few years these children were driven by their developmental age to form ""their own"" ideas and wouldn't listen to their parents. **Peer pressure grew. Children revered the personality of Hitler. Some parents tried to separate their children from their peers over this, but that was not easy and eventually not possible.** If they persisted to try, they were eventually ostracized in their own neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces.  It's no coincidence that Hitler eventually declared himself permanent leader around the time that he began being officially pledged to in schools. It wasn't a big shift, because the children were already doing it on their own. By that time, many political maneuvers had cornered the adults. **They wouldn't contest him, and risk loosing the love of their own children.**

Early on, Hitler's support among children became extremely high and completely independent of the parent. **You need to [watch the history](https://youtu.be/2v2wlXLz0f4?t=36m15s)** if you haven't heard this part of it. You may also know about the Hitler Youth, but it is important that child influence began long before it was started.

**The way they did it should be remembered**. When the child influence campaigns began, the adults did not notice and had no idea of the 10-year plan. In secret, the Nazis wanted to convert the democracy to a dictatorship, and produce a large army in 4-8 years. So, they ""hacked"" child peer-pressure and pubescent development. **8-14 year-olds were the primary target, using influence which the adults couldn't easily control or always notice.** It was the trick which eventually seized full political control over the adults -and- created a large brainwashed army of young people in a short timeframe. It was a brilliant and disgusting manipulation of human resources which quickly created a military dictatorship which came very close to taking over the world.

If **[Trump's speech to the Boy Scouts on Sunday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhTCNLlsvss)** is not a wake-up call on what this man would gladly, effectively do to **your children** or **their classmates**, or **you**, consider:

 * **Trump is already discussed in the schools, for some time**

 * **Often mediated by semi-secret taboo talk** (""grab her"", etc.)

 * **Modern technology allows him to create buzz on the schoolyard via YouTube and smartphones**

 * **At BSA, when he said he would ""kill"" Obamacare, scouts in the audience began chanting ""U-S-A.""**

 * **Trump has used employees in audiences who yell another 1-2-3 rhythm chant: ""Don-ald-Trump!""**

 * **So when will the peak moment occur, that he uses those employees to switch this sort of bloodthirsty ""U-S-A"" chant to ""Lock-Her-Up""?** At next year's Jamboree?

Will we be able to turn back from that moment? Or the next escalation? Or do we need to **act NOW**.
____
____

Intelligence-oriented comments on above:

Hitler's rallies employed hypnotic and rhythmic communication tactics to great effect.

Observe the [entire BSA rally communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhTCNLlsvss). **Observe Trump's cadence, his claps, his words**: the rhythm is  `1-2-3     1-2-3     1-2-3   
  ... `

Observe that he has exhibited the `1-2-3` rhythm with varying but gradually intensifying coherence and amplitude for many months. The most intentionally associated referents for this rhythm in the Trump context are:

* `Don-ald-Trump`
* `U-S-A`
* `Lock-Her-Up`

Several sections of youth + other populations are in close proximity to a **predictable event which would lead to a collective galvanization of violence**.  

These population sections are being very slowly led to this galvanization of violence by the following sequence:

**1. Entrainment**

Expose population to limited but memorable instances of the ""Lock Her Up"" chant associated with rhythmic prompts. [For instance, via Flynn](https://youtu.be/UFBAjhxjQ90?t=1m15s).

Repeat over many months of gradually increasing amplitude:

 1. Entrain crowd to `1-2-3` rhythm
 2. Prompt crowd to cheer for a violent concept
 3. Transition crowd to `U-S-A` or `Don-ald-Trump`

**2. Galvanization**

In 1 to 18 months, it will be the same as above but with an additional step

 1. ...
 2. ...
 3. ...
 4. Transition crowd to `""Lock-Her-Up""`


This completes the intended string of associations in the mind of the target group, awakening it to a collective acknowledgement for the desire for violence against Clinton (and by other managed associations her perceived constituents), which **would be validated by the president.** Verbal validation is not even necessary, a smile and rhythmically pumped fist would work at first.

A few questions about getting into the civilian intelligence field,"
There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of information on what makes an applicant a competitive one when trying to work in intelligence. Does anyone have any input?

Regional experience and a language seem to be big pluses, as well as an active clearance.

Is the military a typical stepping stone to get into the intelligence community?

Without the military, what is the best option? Grad school? 

Do these agencies have entry level jobs that don't require intelligence experience? It seems like they do, but do candidates without experience actually get these jobs?",intelforintel,Intelligence

"""Maddow to news orgs: beware of forged Trump Russia documents!"" - There's something fishy about this story. Tell me what you think.","http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/maddow-to-news-orgs-heads-up-for-hoaxes-985491523709

Brief summary: Rachel Maddow receives anonymously submitted document, highly classified, and purported to come from NSA. This takes place a few days *before* The Intercept publishes Reality Winner's leak. The document sent to Maddow is determined to be a forgery, because it names a US citizen, which legitimate NSA documents of this type wouldn't do - but the interesting thing about it, is that the forgery was made by cutting and pasting portions of Reality Winner's leaked document, in order to give the forgery an appearance of authenticity.

How did the creator of the forged document get their hands on Reality Winner's leak *before The Intercept published it?*

If it was intercepted during the initial mailing by Winner to TI, it would suggest that the hoax creator has access to mass surveillance, which would suggest NSA/CIA, possibly throwing up disinfo to get ahead of the real leak, which they somehow knew was coming. 

If the hoax was created by someone at TI with access to Winner's leak document, it might be the case that someone on TI's staff isn't who they say they are. Intelligence agencies love to infiltrate newspapers - question is, whose intelligence agencies? CIA/NSA? Scary possibility: FSB? Alternate possibility: who did TI shop the Winner leak document around to, in the process of attempting to verify it?

Breaking into the field (Sort of),"Forewarning, I've just recently discovered and explored this sub. I currently work in non-sworn law enforcement, and have for some time. I have a BS in LE, and some military experience (unrelated, basically just good for the check mark on apps). I am applying to various masters programs (Georgetown, USF, MSU, GW, all online) in intelligence-type focuses. Each program is different from the next, and would perhaps lead to different positions. 

I am interested in law enforcement, national security, and homeland security intelligence. Essentially, the whole gambit. So, being a young, ignorant, and wide-eyed future IC professional (kidding, kind of), what can I be doing to land a job in those areas? I know I know, super broad, almost unanswerable question, as each area is so different. LE intel is much more attainable for less experience as opposed to Fed agencies, for example. I'm interested to see responses, though. However broad. 

Thanks!!  ",throwawaygopez,Intelligence

Current Panamenian President is preparing to go on the run. - Panama Papers Reloaded 2.0 -,"Im pretty sure my international friends you have read all about Odebrecht a giant corporation that had its own subdivision within to bribe government officials in order to provide services to various governments, if not here is a super handy link.
http://www.euronews.com/2017/02/23/explained-the-bribery-scandal-engulfing-brazilian-construction-giant-odebrecht
The last three presidents in Panama have been involved in this scandal. Martin Torrijos, Ricardo Martinelli and current president Juan Carlos Varela (former Martinelli's Vice President).
Why does it matter ? and where the fuck is Panama ?
Panama is a tiny country, but it is a country i want to believe in and it is a country i love with all my heart, and it hurts like a bitch to see my loved home country get sunk in the corruption and the mediocracy of our politicians, the lack the vision to steer the country for the ""greater good"" and are only concerned in filling their pockets with tax money by using ""legal"" devices (like offshore accounts) to steal and perpetuate themselves in power to repeat the cycle.
In short, my country is suffering and I firmly believe corruption should be punished -
Here the conspiracy kicks in:
My country recently severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan for no particular reason other than ""economical"" (Taiwan has been a huge partner in development and had provided millions in aid and education.)
http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/13/532788702/panama-cuts-ties-with-taiwan-opts-to-support-china-instead
We established relations with China straight afterwards, the timing is peculiarly odd because briefly after Martinelli was caught in Miami. http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Former-President-of-Panama-Arrested-in-Miami-428068293.html
Well, thats a coincidence, but oh what a monstruosly beautiful coincidence.
Varela is implicated in the Odebrecth scandals he has recieved money from them and is now getting ready to go on the run, this is why he established ties with China so suddenly, no warning of this move.
He has also moved many of his assets to China, the same China that has no extradition laws, and the money he took from Odebrecht was also deposited in their banks.
Martinelli confessed to this shortly after being captured.
I have no idea what to do guys. All i know is im very sure this has all been orchestrated by him in order to avoid justice. (even if simulated as we all know).

Getting a security clearance with a diagnosed mental disorder,"I'm an 18 year old planning to start studying international studies (probably minoring in Korean, and maybe statistics as well) at a D.C. University ranked in the top 10 nationwide for IR (not Georgetown).  I'm really passionate about international politics and became interested in the IC after talking with some of my older classmates in a dual enrollment IR class I took last year.  I have a fairly good idea of what the actual work involves, and I'm hoping to apply for the freshman internship program at the CIA's directorate of operations next year.  

I know this can be a very competitive field to get into, and I'm worried that I will invest too much time in trying to prepare only to be rejected anyway for reasons I can't control.  I was diagnosed with early onset bipolar disorder as a 5 year old, and I was hospitalized twice between the ages of 5 and 6.  Since then I have made a dramatic recovery over years of hard work, and the disorder has had little to no impact on my life since middle school.  I have a therapist, who I have been seeing for almost 8 years.  His role however, has evolved from helping me manage myself as a young kid to simply serving in what I would call a relaxed advisory role.  He would also be more than willing to attest to my progress.  I am medicated, and have been so for as long as I can remember.

Do you think that it would still be possible for me to get a security clearance even with the above?  What could I do to help improve my chances?  Could I work in the private sector without a security clearance or military experience (I'm ineligible to join)?  

I'm just hoping to get a feel for things before I try and map out the next few years.

Remember to save your questions for the live AMA in /r/IAmA at Tuesday 6/6 2PM EST and post them there. Not here in comments.

15 years ago the NSA destroyed the best alternative to mass surveillance: ThinThread. I heard Bill has some exciting news to reveal with you: Now there is a 2.0.

Bill’s live from Amsterdam. Bonus info: He is hanging out there with his friend Kirk Wiebe.

About Bill: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Binney_(U.S._intelligence_official)

Some background on ThinThread: 
In late ninetees Bill co-created the program ""ThinThread"" which was the perfect alternative to mass surveillance - but it was ditched by NSA for money. 

ThinThread was a fully automated system that could monitor signals then filter and alert on genuine threats in near real time. It did this all whilst protecting citizens’ rights to privacy. Its efficacy was down to it being metadata focused. 

See more about the film of ThinThread's story and Bill’s career here: http://agoodamerican.org/

How Black Op Psychology Is Used In Project Monarch.,"There is a lot of techniques of brainwashing being used that are done very covertly. I used to be someone who used Brainwashing, Behavioral Engineering, and Mind Control. A lot of it has to do with learning what the needs are of people and by knowing those needs, you also be default knew the fears that drive those specific needs and therefore also there weaknesses. We all have 7 basic core needs but what I am talking about is those with the extremes for their needs. 

One of the ways I would learn of someone's needs was through the use of more advanced Body Language, Micro Expressions, and obviously by what by what came out of their mouths. Let's say a person's need in the extreme was Approval. I would also know of course the fear driving this need is Dissent. You see by validating a person's needs they in turn open up to us, therefore dropping their guard down. Obviously when their guard is down it's easier to exploit them.

For that we use techniques such as N.L.P. (Neuro Linguistic Programming), Covert Hypnosis, and other more unknown techniques. People are pretty much in a light trance and are in Auto Pilot as they go through life. It's like driving a car to point A, to point B. When you get to point B you know you got there, you are safe but you cannot recall every turn you took or all the stops you made. 

There are techniques that are used to ""Shock"" someone out of this state. There are ways to, to ""anchor"" specific feelings or Associate specific feelings. We can then through either a specific cue word or touch elicit those feelings in that person. There are also ways in which to cause someone to disassociate as well.  It is during these periods we can implant our own suggestions and do it in such a way the person believes the thought or idea was there own. 

We live under the false security that out brains are impenetrable, and because of this we are more vulnerable to Mind Control methods, and Brain Washing. If you have studied MK Ultra, or Project Monarch you too know that it is a reality of creating Alter Personalities in people. That is a bit more advanced and something I won't really go into. I will say one way is through Hypnosis, introduce them to their ""Inner Self"" having them give the Inner Self a name, and so on. Also by the mere suggestion that they have a Alter in them is also strong enough. Then there are ways in which to create amnesia and have them disassociate from their Alters. 

My identity is not even what is important. Who I was and who I am now are what is different.  A lot of what I did I can't go into but I will say Trauma Based Mind Control was probably the worst that I did. I once did very horrible things to people so as to have them disassociate from themselves. I did have my limits though as I never mistreated kids as some handlers did. There were some that started on those who were just babies. They would put their fingers in Mouse Traps, and other such cruel things and would not comfort the child until they learned to disassociate and not cry from the pain.

It is here when the splitting of personalities would occur as a means of survival. When things are so horrific our minds seek escape and one way is to create these alters. Natural, and Suggested Amnesia occurs so that the personalities don't know of the others existence. I'm sure you know of Michael Aquino and his work on this subject. He was a very evil guy. That is something I know but how I know I won't go into.

The creation of alters in Older people is a bit trickier. The use of sedatives are often used like Ativan, Xanax and other benzodiazepines. After applying those we could induce trance states much easier, then through positive and negative reinforcements we could really get the behaviors we wanted. So yes it goes way beyond N.L.P., P.U.A. even Hypnosis. All I can do is speak of what I personally know of.

The Story of the Tunisian Journalist Who Took Part in the Assassination of Tunisian Aeronautics Expert and UAV builder Zawari [translated article],"The translation is from Arabic. It is a news story about how a seemingly innocent Tunisian female journalist was employed by the assassins of Mohamed al Zawawi, a Tunisian engineer who was reportedly building drones for Palestinian Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip. 

[Context: Zawawi was shot killed in front of his house in Tunisia last December by unknown assailants. The attack was blamed on Israel's Mossad but no official claim was made.]

The translation below is word by word from this [source, a London-based Arabic newspaper](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/medianews/2017/5/2/%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A).

**The Story of the Tunisian Journalist Who Took Part in the Assassination of Zawari**

When the Tunisian public prosecutor sent Tunisian female journalist Maha Hamoudah to prison for its participation in the assassination of engineer Mohamed Zawari in Sfax, her region was gripped by confusion.

According to special security sources, the young Tunisian journalist was looking for a job after finishing her university studies. She browsed the web until she stumbled upon a website that asked for applications by journalists wishing to launch media projects in many parts of the world. She turned in her CV in June 2016 and got a response in August, 2016, from the website operators. She was asked to travel to Vienna, Austria, to take the necessary tests. They provided her with a travel ticket and accommodation.


The young woman quickly prepared her papers to travel to Vienna. There, a foreign man, likely a Belgian, received her. He spoke to her about producing documentary films in six Arab countries, including Tunisian, which will then be broadcast on a Malaysian TV station known as ""TV 1"". Then, this man introduced her to another European of an Arab origin, who spoke Arabic well, to become her direct operator.

On 6 September 2016, her operator contacted her to tell her of a plan to produce a documentary about aviation, medicine and leadership in Arab countries. He asked to pay attention to a Tunisian aviation engineer known as Mohamed Zawari.


He told her that this person [Zawari] was known for his expertise in building UAVs and that she will be paid €100 a day in addition her travel costs and sundries. Maha agreed to this and headed after her return to Samanja, a small town in the province of Zighwan (50 km from the capital Tunis), to film an event about aviation. Then, Zawari was taking part in this event. She later handed over the pictures to her operator who rewarded her €2000. 

Then, her operators asked to cover the activity of an association in the city of Sfax, so that she gets to know one person who introduced her to martyr Zawari. She introduced herself as a journalist working for TV 1 station. She then held a TV interview with him and accompanied him to his home and many other places that he frequented in Sfax. She then supplied her operator with a recording of the interview with martyr Zawari,. This might have been used to monitor the details of the engineer's life.


Her media work with the foreign operator continued. On 12 December 2016, three days before the assassination, she was asked to rent two cards, park them at two specific locations and leave the keys inside. These were the two cars that were used in the assassination of Zawari. 


On the day of the assassination, 15 December 2016, her operator asked her to travel to the Hungarian capital, Budapest, for an important matter. However, the Tunisian authorities contacted her and convinced her that she was going to be liquidated. They asked her to change her place of residence quickly which she did. She returned to Tunisia on 16 December and was picked up by the Tunisian security at the Carthage international airport. She was interrogated then remanded in custody.

I'm wondering if anyone has a link to a list of other methods for detecting leaks and/or moles? I'm sure this is something the IC has wargamed plenty, I just haven't seen much reading material, so if you don't have a link, any tips on alternative methods in the same vein?

edit: and of course this is angled for civ consumption, I'm not asking for details on how to actually detect moles/leakers if you are the one in power (because there are methods there that don't apply in civland), I'm looking for more information warfare academic methods that a civ could apply to, say, their company org.",redteamalphamale,Intelligence

Could it have neutralized the U.S. ability to respond to a first strike?

If Russia doesn't want to attack the United States militarily, why is it acting this way? It seems as if the logical outcome of the way Russia is acting is a hot war. Why would Russia do all of this and be confident that it will avoid a hot war?

Question about security clearance and foreign influence,"My boyfriend is a contractor for a large defense corporation and holds a security clearance. He disclosed our relationship and was advised that he can continue dating me, but would lose his job if he marries me. He did not provide them with details about my family when he originally disclosed the relationship, but I am wondering if the following would make a difference, since the agency's concern was my parents' assumed ties to Russia. I am originally from Russia but lived in US since I was 8 years old. I've only travelled back once and do not keep in touch with anyone there. I have a dual citizenship but can renounce the Russian one, if need be. My parents have each went back about 5 times over the past 19 years to visit their own parents. Currently, there are only two surviving grandparents left, and we do not keep in touch with the remainder of our family. We also have no financial ties and do not own any property or anything at all over there. We also do not know anyone with any influence abroad or anyone with political ties. So essentially no ties at all. Would anyone be able to advise if this would make a difference in him being able to keep his job/ clearance if our relationship progresses? ",boopyou,Intelligence

Allen Dulles could've told the Russians that their last-minute attacks on Macron wouldn't work,"In the Craft of Intelligence, Dulles tells a classic and hilarious story. KGB was trying to blackmail a French ambassador with pictures they took of him and his mistress in flagrante delicto.  They sat him down and showed him the pictures, expecting him to be so frightened that he would do anything they asked.  Instead, the ambassador looks at the pictures, looks at them, and basically says' ""wow these are super hot, you got some great angles!  Could I borrow some of these to show my wife?  It would really spice things up in the bedroom, I think she'd love it!""


All this time, and the Russians still don't understand the French.  All the lies and accusations they tried to throw around, the French just couldn't have cared less.  

""He does drugs!""  -  *Mais oui, mon ami, who doesn't these days?*

""He's gay!"" - *Zee last presidente kicked his girlfriend out of the presidential residence so his new, hotter girlfriend could move in, and that sounded fair to us.  We just don't give a damn what people get up to between the sheets!*

We're talking about a candidate who married his high-school teacher 24 years his senior, and the French look at that and say, *eh, sounds like true love, what a beautiful thing.  bet it was pretty hot and dirty.  good for them.*

Also, there's a general understanding in their media that doesn't forget who Putin is and how he got here, a dictator who unconstitutionally seized power in Russia by threatening his friends, murdering his enemies, seizing the people's wealth and auctioning off their national resources to his coterie of creeps.

If anything, I would suggest that the Russian disinfo op galvanized national support against Le Pen.  Macron performed ten points better in the election than his best polls had him at in the days before the election.  The French are just so damn *French,* the Russians just don't grok them at their core, and the French have a serious distaste for anyone as backwards as Putin.",reptiliansentinel,Intelligence

United States Special Operations Command 15 Years of Continuous War,"[U.S. SOCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Special_Operations_Command) Commander 
[General Raymond A. Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_A._Thomas) during his [testimony during the HASC Hearings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLqtSHRZVmo) on May 2nd, states his organization has been in continuous combat for 15 years (He starts at [11:45](https://youtu.be/bLqtSHRZVmo?t=705)).  In [120+ counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Special_Operations_Command#Global_presence).  There are only [195](http://www.worldometers.info/geography/how-many-countries-are-there-in-the-world/) countries in the world.  Let that sink in.

After seeing the blazing red shirt Ms. Whalen wore during her testimony, I wondered if SOCOM was the ""U.S. Far-Right Activists"" the [NYTimes claimed were 'Promoting Hacking Attack Against Macron'](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-hack-french-election-marine-le-pen.html).  Ms. Whelan emphasised SOCOM digital IO operations as did Gen Raymond all throughout the hearings.  SOCOM is also known to focus on memetic warfare, even [having a pin for it](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a507172.pdf), which is one of the claims of the NYTimes articles.  Is the U.S. tampering with a foreign countries elections?  An ally to boot?

IO - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Operations_(United_States)

Also, does anyone know any more about Softworks, which Congresswoman Murphy [asked about](https://youtu.be/bLqtSHRZVmo?t=1968)?  According to her, SOCOM started it in downtown Tampa a year ago to provide recruiting support (vaguely defined).",webdoodle,Intelligence

When a case involving abuse of surveillance or some other form of misconduct is alleged against an intelligence officer what would be the proper procedures for the court?  Would the case be referred to FISA?  Would the NSA or CIA take over?  How would that happen?

Merkel cooperates with the British Secret Intelligence Service,"Much has been said lately of a scandal that involves the German Chancellor Angela Merkel who has allegedly sold secret data obtained by the German intelligence (BND) in exchange for assistance in countering the Islamist threat. Quite predictably, the Media in pursuit for a sensation tried to overblow the story. Anger of the BND has been less reasoned but rather understandable either. Yet, talks of wasted years of intelligence gathering and, even worse, of [Merkel's treason](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/merkel-had-secret-briefing-from-mi6-on-terrorism-strategy-m5nj9kbrz) have been totally inexplicable, however.

http://i.imgur.com/kMyc9dl.jpg

Cooperation with friendly security services for the sake of nation's safety cannot be considered as treason. That is the reason 14 Eyes were created for, so that civilized states could effectively fight international threats. Merkel did the right thing. That is a step to joining the UKUSA Agreement and a transition to a new closer partnership on her part. At last the German government left demagoguery and childish resentments to move towards sensible and decisive actions.

Partners have to help each other. We've got common aims and similar vision of the world problems. And exchanges of experience would benefit both us and BND. It's odd enough that the Chancellor's actions lacked understanding in her country. That is a brilliant move of a far-sighted politician concerned with the safety of the people dependent on her. The more transparency and shared information channels we have the more fruitful our cooperation will be.",wendelzip,Intelligence
