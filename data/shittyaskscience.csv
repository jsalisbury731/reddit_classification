I would think it would be more efficient than a water based lube because if you use to much of a water based lube, it would create a new source of friction.

It would also be a lot cleaner because if you spill it, you don't have to clean it right away, and you can just use a normal eraser to remove it.

With a water based lube, unless you are a terrible person who likes living in a dirty, stained, and unkempt house (you outta be ashamed of yourself), you would have to clean it up right away to prevent damage to your furniture/carpet/etc. which would ruin the mood.

So since we gotta drink like 8 cups of water a day, cant we just make like h160 or smth so we just gotta drink like 1 cup a day instead? (i only drink like 2 cups a day though cause I aint like water)

Retrofitting old military tech to fight bushfires a good idea?,"I live in Adelaide, Australia and raise funds in my own time for the Country Fire Service. These guys are absolute legends at the front of the action, driving into literal hell. They are only equipped with trucks, PPE and will get assistance from a limited and expensive air force which dump retardant/water to control blazes. We lost many lives fighting fire directly and in plane crashes, yet much of their efforts were not enough to protect the thousands of homes which got destroyed. 

Now hear me out,
My idea is to repurpose old Multiple Rocket Launch Systems, which fire dozens upon dozens of unguided rockets- except the catch is- the warheads are all that's left when the fuel is spent, hence they've already been used to lay smoke screens. If we were to fit a large firefighting bomb at the tip of these weapons, we could easily coat a whole neighbourhood or small town with retardant. Here is a video which can help you visualise what that may look like. The launch may cost a few thousand bucks, but if it saves a few dozen homes or controls a blaze I feel it is not a lavish investment. https://youtu.be/2kdfbwgnQfQe

These systems are designed to be accurate, but non-precise. They are easy to use, 6 wheel drive, only require a small crew of 3 and can safely operate far away from the blaze.

Is this new universe theory possible,"So we can only guess what the universe holds.  We don't know how big it is or what's at the end. But I have an idea.

So we are on the earth. We haven't found any life yet. We are in a solar system. In a galaxy. My theory is that there are infinite universes both bigger and smaller. 

We are one atom for someone else. One planet is one atom.....

It might sound crazy but hear me out

One grain of sand has 43 Quintilian atoms.  That means there are 43 quntilian planets in that grain of stand. And how many grains of sand are in the world. Then how many atoms are in the world...

You do the math. But that's how many planets are in the world.

Now that applies to us.

We are just one atom in something that's much bigger than us. And that is the same for them. And so on.

It also goes smaller. And smaller.

So atoms are just planets and planets are atoms

"What would happen if you froze an egg in the middle of an 8"" cube of ice, then moved it straight from the freezer into a 2000° kiln","I'm thinking that to put it in the ice, you'd fill an 8"" silicone cube mold halfway up with water, freeze it, then drill/melt out a hole just big enough for the egg to sit in, then put the egg in, fill the rest of the mold with room temperature water (so it melts a little bit of the ice, which should prevent a seam from forming between the layers) and then freeze again. Once fully frozen, remove the block from the mold and put it back in the freezer to counteract any melting that may have occurred during de-molding. At this point, you can start up the kiln. Once the kiln is up to temp, quickly transfer the ice block using chilled steel tongs, and shut the kiln door as quickly as possible. Carrying the block may require both hands, so it could be helpful to have an assistant standing by to shut the door. Wait 30 seconds, or until you hear a BANG! - whichever comes first - then open the door and observe the results.

A more thorough version of this experiment would involve making a bunch of these frozen egg cubes and baking them for different amounts of time and at different temperatures. You could also vary the size of the cubes, and maybe even the eggs. Hell, you could even try it with multiple eggs in one cube - I certainly wouldn't stop you!

How to share the gospel with atheists,"Last week I sat next to James on a flight from St. Louis to Denver. As we talked the subject turned to religion. I confessed that I was a preacher and he confessed he was an atheist. What unfolded on the rest of the flight was a deep, thought-provocative gospel conversation.

Over the years I’ve had the privilege of engaging many atheists like James in various settings. I’ve discovered five helpful tips when sharing the gospel with someone who says to not believe in God.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Don’t be shocked and do ask tons of questions:

&amp;#x200B;

Some atheists like to shock believers with the fact that they don’t believe in God. This brand of atheist pulls the pin on the “there is no God” grenade and drops it in the middle of the conversation, expecting believers to run for cover.

Don’t be phased. As a matter of fact start asking questions about their atheism. Find out what they mean by atheism (some are agnostics but call themselves atheists). Ask questions about their background.

And remember that, as you ask questions, your goal is not to trap them but to understand them. Find out areas where you agree. Just like Paul found common ground with the athenians when he discovered an altar “to the unknown God” we can find common ground in a mutual rejection of legalistic religion and a passion for science

Although James spoke somewhat negatively of religion he spoke well of Jesus. While he didn’t view Jesus as the Son of God he did perceive him as an enlightened soul. At the minimum that was something I could build on in making my own case for Christ.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Listen deeply for the real “why”:

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it’s anger over losing a loved one or because they were hurt by the church in some way. Sometimes there other reasons, like the fact that they are afraid of the truth, because if they embraced the truth, they would be submitted to God, and would not be free as they were before; so they prefer to embrace a lie which makes them freer. Whatever the reason, there’s always a “why” behind the lie they are embracing.

James shared with me about his upbringing in England and his regular attendance at the Church of England. He told me about how his wife had left him and how he could only see his kids every other weekend. James shared how he reads at least a book a week and how he loses himself in novels.

As he shared I couldn’t quite nail why he was an atheist but I could sense that he was a lonely man. My heart went out to him and I think he could sense my sympathy.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Connect relationally:

&amp;#x200B;

James and I joked together as we sparred each other. I listened to him and he listened to me. Bottom line is that I like James. He is an interesting guy with an interesting story.

We should heed Paul’s reminder to Timothy about how to deal with those who disagree with us theologically,

“Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will” (2 Timothy 2:23-26).

&amp;#x200B;

4. Atheists knew the truth:

&amp;#x200B;

Those who claim to be atheists have known the truth (i.e. God), but have rejected it. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Scripture makes it clear in Romans 1:18-22:

&amp;#x200B;

""For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools"" (Romans 1:18-22).

&amp;#x200B;

They may try to suppress their belief in God, but in the discussion, atheists might say something like, “Well if God is so good then why does he allow…” This is the point in the conversation where they have “forgotten” their atheism and revealed some of their doubts. You can be sure that, the gospel is churning in the soul of the atheist.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Frame the gospel as a love story (that just happens to be true):

&amp;#x200B;

When I shared the gospel with James I wasn’t trying to prove God’s existence, I was simply sharing the story of God’s love. I said something like, “James, at the core of Christianity is a love story. Jesus put it this way, ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him will not perish but has everlasting life"" (John 3:16).

I could tell that James was intrigued by this view. He listened respectfully and asked thoughtful questions.

Yes, I dipped into some apologetics at this point (C.S. Lewis’ Lord, lunatic or liar argument, teleological argument, etc.) but only after I had framed the gospel as a love story. In the words of my friend Bill Jack, too many times too many believers use apologetics as a sledge hammer instead of a crowbar to pry open closed minds.

James and I had a respectful conversation where I heard him and he heard the good news of Jesus. My job is not to lead him to Jesus but to “set forth the truth plainly” and let the Spirit of God continues his work.

James didn’t say the sinner’s prayer when the plane pulled up to the gate after landing. But I believe that somewhere between Denver and St. Louis the Spirit of God nudged him closer to Jesus. It is my prayer that he will cross the line of faith and receive Jesus as his Savior.",Orion2087,shittyaskscience

Kinda complex question just read thanks," 

if we cover a human with a sheet with some type of paint to imprint the sheet in detail (under, over, fold) and lets say the sheet is 4 ft x 16 ft, and we leave a little space for the top of the head so it does show the top of the head when rolled out but instead a more detailed shape of front and back of the head. how much space will be left in between the frontal image (limited to hairline, normal forehead, aka can fit 4 fingers nicely and not receeded) to the back head image (in the middle of the bend from back to top of head)? and is there any illustration i can see so i can compare it to something im personally working on? here is an image, can someone tell me if these dimensions are realistic [http://www.ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Shroud-of-Turin-full-length.jpg](http://www.ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Shroud-of-Turin-full-length.jpg)

Any help in Thermodynamics?,"Hello everyone,

  
Well, I'm an undergrad Computer Science student, and I have a Thermodynamics exam after 2 days. I'm currently studying (started days before) it but I have a fear of not passing it effectively. Whole semester I've dealt with a bunch of uni-related and outer projects on my own major; either as evaluations or practice improvement for my future career (just took the advantage of quarantine). Hense, unfortunately, I've skipped Thermodynamics classes. Even attended other physics classes with high interest but just not this one, because of, let's say, self priority.. And my concern comes about it rn. There wasn't any midterm exam or lab sessions to compensate the overall of this subject. Therefore all overall will be only that exam, ugh.

So, i would like to ask, is there any kind-hearted physics genius out there that can help me? I would really appreciate if someone just help me in 2-3 multiple-choice questions (maybe i'll handle them as well but still i have a huge doubt and concern, tho) during the exam.

10 Facts About Human Cannibalism From Modern Science," 

Cannibalism is the act of eating a member of the same species and, while disgusting to most of us, is an extremely common practice throughout the animal kingdom. There are plenty of reasons for cannibalism, such as religious practices, serial murder, or just lack of food in the case of humans. Many other animals will engage in cannibalism without a second thought. Some animals that will, at times, eat members of their own species might surprise you, like the hippo, certain types of bears, salamanders, worms, and various other species.  
While animals may do it, somehow, we see as ourselves separate until a complete madman reminds us that we, too, are susceptible to cannibalistic tendencies. Is it possible that, pushed far enough, any one of us human beings possesses the ability to turn into a cannibal? The human race has been pressed plenty since the dawn of history, and we’ve resorted to cannibalism for many reasons. Today, the modern sciences can tell us a lot about cannibalism as we piece together the story of human history and its relationship with the practice. Here are ten facts about human cannibalism that we know thus far.

**10 Prehistoric Humans**

With all of the current scientific and anthropological literature that we have now, one could say with the utmost of extreme confidence that cannibalism is as old as humanity itself. Evidence in the way of bite, cut, and tool marks have demonstrated that humans would occasionally delve into cannibalism, feasting on their friends, relatives, and fellow tribespeople.\[2\]

This wasn’t always done due to a lack of food, either. Many instances of prehistoric cannibalism have been found accompanied by homicide and intertribal warfare. In fact, the entire globe is replete with archaeological digsthat confirm the basic facts, that prehistoric humans were violent, murderous, and of course, cannibalistic, even in times when an abundance of food was present.

**9 Neanderthals**

Neanderthals also practiced cannibalism, quite like we did. There have been excavations of grave sites which have confirmed that Neanderthals would kill, cut up, and eat each other. We know this from the presence of tools, however rudimentary, used for cutting straight lines through bone. These wouldn’t have been used for combat, where blunt force trauma would be expected. Also there are bones with damage that is not consistent with animal attacks, which don’t deliver clean cuts into or through bone.

One site excavated in Krapina, Croatia, contains scattered, fragmentary remains of many Neanderthals. In addition to the clues mentioned above, the skeletal remains at Krapina contain bones which have been burned, which some scientists have touted as clear evidence of cannibalism.

**8 Natural**

For all the disgust and repulsion we feel when we imagine ourselves taking a big, juicy bite of human flesh, the fact is that cannibalism among animals is surprisingly common and, most of all, a perfectly natural part of the behavior of organisms—including humans. Along with it being a natural, albeit comparatively rare (for humans), behavior, cannibalism is built into at least a very dark corner of the fabric of the human existence. As we’ve discussed, people have been eating people all across the globe for the entirety of human existence.

Cannibalism is likely a natural, innate trait that needs to be activated under certain environmental stimuli. The 1972 crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 shows that even modern humans, who are typically repulsed by the idea and may even have deeply held religious convictions against it, will eat one another if push comes to shove, stuck in the deep, bone-chilling cold, with no recourse for   
help.

**7 Kuru**

Kuru is a sweet little bit of karma in the form of a prion that devastatingly infects the human brain. Kuru was especially prominent among the Fore people in New Guinea, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s. “Kuru” is a Fore word meaning “to shiver” or “trembling in fear.” Kuru throws its victim off-balance, making simple motor activities more and more difficult as time goes on; it is typically fatal within a year of being contracted.\[5\]

In a quite macabre twist of fate, victims of kuru end up dying of dementia, as the prion from the consumed brain tissue ends up infecting the brain of the consumer. Kuru is slow, steady, and downright awful, so if you were considering cannibalism, particularly eating human brains, take this as a warning: You can catch some seriously nasty pathogens by doing so and end up losing your life within a year.

Are There Methods to Increase the Effectiveness of Face Masks/Coverings?,"So with the virus pandemic that is raging on, and all the increasing calls for quarantines, social distancing, and mandatory face coverings when going outdoors, I was wondering if there are any makeshift, but effective methods that one may use to increase the effectiveness of whatever meager PPE they have on hand? 

With all the panic buying going on, actual useful supplies (not TP) such as good quality masks, rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, disinfectant, etc. are increasingly hard to come by - I've seen people wearing scarves and gaiters in lieu of masks, and I began to wonder if wetting the fabric in some sort of solution would increase their effectiveness.

My first thought was to soak the covering in alcohol or disinfectant, but that is clearly a no-go because of having hazardous fumes in such close proximity to your nose and mouth. Then I thought about using oil to help the covering attract more contaminants... I think an oil soaked mask will be a lot better at filtering out dust particles, and with oil being a non-polar molecule, it might also increase the mask's ability to filter out suspended droplets, which is a known transmission vector of the coronavirus.

I was also interested in knowing whether high or low pH environments can destroy or impede the virus... I got this idea when I was running low on disinfectant spray and began to wonder if vinegar or baking soda could be used to disinfect household surfaces. (Thankfully, I was able to buy a large bottle of Everclear from a local liquor store recently.) If you were to search for the effects of pH on the virus right now, you will see a bunch of articles pop up about a quack practice of eating high alkaline foods with a false belief that this will increase pH levels within the body. I'm looking for information on whether acids/bases could be used as a disinfectant to kill the virus outside the body, so the information is more difficult to find, but this is what I've found so far:

* [Viruses of the coronavirus family are most stable at a slightly acidic pH between 6-6.5. The virus is less stable at a pH above 8. (The pH of baking soda is 9)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509683/)
&gt; The sensitivity of coronaviruses to pH variations has been established for a number of them. They are more stable at slightly acidic pH (6 – 6.5) than at alkaline pH (8). This has been shown for the HCoV 229E, the MHV, the TGEV and the canine coronavirus.

* [A study on noroviruses concluded that baking soda can be used to effectively kill noroviruses on contact on food.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16540196) [And generally speaking, coronaviruses are easier to kill than noroviruses](https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/infectious-disease/How-we-know-disinfectants-should-kill-the-COVID-19-coronavirus/98/web/2020/03)
&gt; The use of sodium bicarbonate alone or in combination with aldehydes can be an effective and inexpensive method of disinfecting food contact surfaces.
&gt; Enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2—which rely on a protective lipid coating—are the easiest type to deactivate. In contrast with many gastrointestinal viruses like norovirus which have a tough protein shell called a capsid, viruses with this fatty wrapping are relatively vulnerable.

So after this research, I was wondering if would be a good idea if one were to pour some baking soda onto a mask and then wet it with a few drops of water so the solution will soak into the fabric and then put the mask on. The idea I'm working with here is to either make the mask or covering less permeable to dust and droplets (with the oil), or make the mask a more hostile environment for the virus (with the baking soda). Am I on to something, or is what I said just nonsense?",LifeWhereas7,shittyaskscience

\---  
Cannalogue is absolutely NOT claiming any sort of prevention, treatment, or cure.   


However, there's enough evidence that warrants further investigation, especially when there's no definite treatment available.  


The study will involve broad spectrum oil, mainly CBD, which will be consumed orally. There will be NO smoking or vaping.   


Here is some evidence predicating the research study:  
a) CBD anti-inflammation:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/)

Have there been any updates on immunity after recovering from SARS-CoV-2?,"Watching the Virtual Town Hall today with POTUS &amp; ""The Force"", he stated that if people took an antibody test which showed they had already been infected and recovered from the disease, they would be able to return to work.

Last I was aware, researchers were working to determine how long immunity from the virus lasted after exposure (if at all: [https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/20/819038431/do-you-get-immunity-after-recovering-from-a-case-of-coronavirus](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/20/819038431/do-you-get-immunity-after-recovering-from-a-case-of-coronavirus). There was a chance that one could be continuously reinfected, or that the virus itself may he neiroinfectious. ([https://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/blog/breakingnews/pages/post.aspx?PostID=908](https://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/blog/breakingnews/pages/post.aspx?PostID=908))

So... has something new happened on this front to make them confident that reinfection isn't possible if those antibodies are present? Given how this disease works, by my (completely unqualified, uneducated, and untrained) reckoning, if you get reinfected repeatedly it could just continually get worse and worse no matter what your age is, based on scarring to lung tissue/compounding lingering effects of the disease ([https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-recovered-patients-have-partially-reduced-lung-function/a-52859671](https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-recovered-patients-have-partially-reduced-lung-function/a-52859671)).

This might help to explain the reason there have been cases of young / healthy people that have had a multiphasic experience wherein they have no symptoms, mild symptoms, no symptoms, moderate, and progressively worse until they end up on seriously I'll or dead.

Also, this was just brought to my attention, which, again, begs the question: if the virus is this unstable, does the presence of antibodies indicate immunity?

Naturally, I became curious as to whether it is possible to extract the ethanol from either the fish's environment or from their bodies to make drinking alcohol. I read a little about the process online and found that much of the ethanol is excreted into the fish's environment, but that much of it is retained in the muscles and liver. I was wondering if it is possible to extract it from either the water (which would require filtering out the ammonia and other waste) or from the meat of the fish.

The very concept of time travel is flawed (rant),"Im no physicist but it seems to me like time flowing foreward is a result of the law of entropy which is basically just that all energy moves from a state of order to a state of disorder, so in order to reverse time one would have to reverse empathy which I feel like might have unexpected effects on the way physics work.


And even if none of that is true and one could directly travel backwards through time it seems to me like probability would become a major factor. Say one flips a coin and the coin lands on heads, that coin had a 50 percent chance to land either way so if one were to go back in time and flip the same coin again that coin still has a 50 percent chance to land on tails, so basically if one were to go directly back in time the result would be a different future beyond anyones control.

So if I went back in time to before I was born the simple act of me doing so may very well result in me never being born even if I myself did not interact with anyone or anything.",FellatiatedPiece,shittyaskscience

STEM undergrad research help,"DESPERATE STEM UNDERGRAD RESEARCH HELP

I’m an undergraduate majoring in Genetics, Cell, and Developmental Biology. My main interest is in genetics. I plan getting at least my Masters. Right now, I am in the process of finding a research internship in order to make connections and build my resume. I have met with 4 labs so far and am really having trouble choosing who to go with. I’ll list them and a description below...any advice would be greatly appreciated.
1) Professor originally from Germany working on studying evolution through sequencing and comparing the genomes of different species. Seems very friendly and understanding. Small lab, but room to grow. The downside is that it is all dry lab, mostly computer work. I have never done this before and don’t know if I would like it or be good at it. She said she would place me with a grad student working on lizard species to start with. Not in love with lizards, so but I do love animals. 
2) Young professor who just moved in from Canada. Cell biologist who is interested in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). His lab is brand new, and he is a bit all over the place project wise. But again, very nice person and I would have room to grow. Good opportunity to do hands on learning with a variety of lab techniques. He would start me off working on ATP Synthase. Not super genetics oriented, but I think I could work my way to something more related to my interests. 
3) Grad student looking for someone to help her with her malaria research. Involves wet lab with mosquitoes. Room to grow. Not currently related to genetics, but the project is in the early stages and could certainly end up being more genetics oriented. Opportunity for as little or as few hours as I want, and opportunity to continue for more than one semester. 
4) Mayo Clinic MD. She is working on genetic cancer syndromes and testing for them. She is SCARY. Super direct, short, and harsh. But a total badass. She wants me to read research papers and write a series of short papers (which I’ve never done) with the hopes of eventually turning it into a research proposal. Basically throwing me off the deep end. Could learn SO much from her, but she’s extremely busy and doesn’t have much time. I wouldn’t be doing any work in the actual lab, which I don’t love. She’s scary, but she would definitely look the best on my resume as a reference. She’s got power behind her name and titles.",unusuallytired,shittyaskscience

The 6 Letter. (The 6 Theory). xLetter from r/aliens.,"**Comet 16.** Dear Super Mods. I've posted this letter on  r/aliens  because obviously that's the best place for an alien to find more aliens or to hang out with them.  But i was kicked out  because apparently I'm not a real alien. So, I posted it on r/sex, because where else. But my post was removed again because they say that I'm an alien and I don't really know anything about sex. So now,  I'm trying to land it here, because someone suggested that my letter is just a shitty theory. So please, if you want to kick me out, do me at least a favour and tell me a good place to land. Because I'm really  running out of options. Thanks a lot.   

**The 6 Theory.** The Theory of Sex simply states that, s3x without love is just sex with a future ex.

**The Sexy Formula.** The Formula for Sex.

**s\*x = s3x / 2**

Super \* Love \* Sex / 2 &gt; 100% = Super Sex

Super Sex = Sex + Love = Sex \* Super = s3x = Super Friends

Selfish Sex = Sex – Love = Sex – Super = sex - s = ex

Happy Single = Sex – ex = s+ = Single + Super = Single + Sex

Super Single = Single – super = \*s = Single – Sex = Zero Sex

Super Love = Love – Sex = &lt;3 = Friends – Sex = Just Friends

&amp;#x200B;

**The 6 Letter.**

Dear aliens,

I hope you’re still alive,

But if not, please read my Letters.

**Comet 6.** Anyway, as you know, my dream is to be a scientist and to win the human prize. And today I would like to share with you one of my best theories, the Theory Number 6. And I wrote this theory for my imaginary girlfriend because she is my best friend and the only friend I’ve got. And because I don’t have any human friends, I thought that maybe I should share some of them with you. So, here is my Sexy Theory, please take a look and tell me what you think. And if you like it, please leave me a comet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Theory 6.** The Theory of Sex simply states that, s3x without love is just sex with a future ex. 

**The Sexy Formula.** The Formula for Sex.

**s\*x = s3x / 2 &gt; 100%**

Super Sex = Super \* Love \* Sex / 2 &gt; 100%

Super Sex = Sex + Love = Sex \* Super = s3x = Super Friends

Selfish Sex = Sex – Love = Sex – Super = sex - s = ex

Happy Single = Sex – ex = s+ = Single + Super = Single + Sex

Super Single = Single – super = \*s = Single – Sex = Zero Sex

Super Love = Love – Sex = &lt;3 = Friends – Sex = Just Friends

sex = s\*x / 2 = if / 2 = ꓥ / V \* y / λ / 2

s\*x = Super Sex = s\*x / 2 = if / 2 = i {f\*} \* f / 2 \* 100%

s/x = Selfish Sex = s / x = -i {i} / -f {f} / 2 \* 100%

i = Positive intensity = ꓥ / V

\-i = Negative intensity = -ꓥ -V

f\* = Super frequency = i &gt; f ≤ f

f = Positive frequency = y / λ

\-f = Negative frequency = -y -λ 

ꓥ = Positive Volume = ꓥ(x) /t ≥ 0

\-ꓥ = Negative Volume = ꓥ(x) /t &lt; 0

V = Positive Value = V(x) /t ≥ \*x

\-V = Negative Value = V(x) /t &lt; \*x

oV = Zero Value = 0V = -1

y = Positive Velocity = y(x) /t ≥ 0

\-y = Negative Velocity = y(x) /t &lt; 0

λ = Positive Wavelength = λ(x)/t ≥ 0

\-λ = Negative Wavelength = λ(x) /t &lt; 0

oλ = Unknown Wavelength = \*x

s\*x = Super Sex = s3x

Σ\*x = Total Super Sex = Σ\*x &gt; 100%

s\*x̅ = Average Super Sex = s\*x̅ = Σ\*x /t(\*x) &gt; 100%

s = super, single; 3 = &lt;3 = Love; \*x = Super Sex = 8

t = time = !24/8 xT

&amp;#x200B;

**BBQ 22. Do you have a Sex Experiment to test your sexy theory?** Yes, I have, but it’s not ready yet. It still needs some testing. And my imaginary girlfriend doesn’t want to help me out. She doesn’t even want to hear anything about sex right now, not even for science. She thinks that I don’t really love her, and unless I can prove that I really love her she will never come to sleep with me. So, right now I’m stuck, and I can’t really test this theory. So, for the moment, let’s use the experiment &lt;33, until I will work out something with my imaginary girlfriend.

**BBQ X. what is a BBQ?** BBQ is an acronym for the “Best Boring Questions”, or in short, a barbeque. So, how was my barbeque? Do you like it? And if you do, just send me a unicorn. But if not, then give your unicorns to nobody and nobody will be happy. And if you have a boring question, or a question that nobody can answer, then shoot me a star, or just leave me a comet, and I’ll make some barbeque for you. They say that nobody can change the world, and maybe they’re right, so let’s help nobody.

However, one of them has a few small dents and is wet in beer, as if the beer had somehow magically sweated through the can.

INGREDIENTS

Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1¼ cups all-purpose flour
½ cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon ground allspice
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
2 large eggs, room temperature
1 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1 cup canned pure pumpkin
½ cup virgin coconut oil, warmed, slightly cooled
Frosting

4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
⅔ cup confectioners sugar, sifted
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
Kosher salt
 
RECIPE PREPARATION
Cake

Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly coat an 8x8"" baking dish with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2"" overhang on all sides. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, salt, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl.

Whisk eggs, pumpkin, brown sugar, and oil in another large bowl until smooth. Mix in dry ingredients. Scrape batter into prepared baking dish; smooth top.


Bake cake until edges begin to pull away from sides of dish and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 30–35 minutes. Let cool.

Frosting and assembly

Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl just to combine. Reduce speed to low and gradually add sugar, then maple syrup and salt; beat until smooth. Spread frosting over top of cooled cake.

Hey science, build me a car 

I want it to run on quarks and muons.

remove the wires, destroy the circuitry. 

char the remains, we must start over.

burn it.

not to wires, boards, batteries, and lemons 

the quarks would lose their charm 

the muons would be mildly dissatisfied.  

&amp;#x200B;

pass that quark rope over here 

wrap it around this muon charger 

ride the wave function to the Higgs' boson hole 

let those particles get strange together 

then we’ll be ready to go

Is it possible that time is oscillating?,"Is it possible that time is oscillating between two (or possibly more than two) nodes. According to the 'Arrow of time', time is asymmetric. So, abiding by this concept, we can consider time to move in one direction for the span it travels from a given start point to a given end point. It can be assumed that time then stops, i.e. reaches a no time phase. Here, it rearranges itself and reverses its direction, aligning it towards the other node (Or maybe it doesn't stop, just reverses). In this way it keeps oscillating between the nodes.
These nodes could be like 2 'Big Bangs' having opposite effects, with one resulting in an explosion and leading the universe into randomness (an increase in entropy takes place), while the other occurring as a result of, the need for orderliness (as a result of various forces of attraction), causing a collision.

I'm being investigated by police after a routine examination found a fully preserved skeleton inside my body. Any explanation?,"Sorry for the wall of text but I'm in a desperate situation. I'm trying to find a rational explanation for this which I can present to the police. During a routine examination, doctors have found a fully preserved skeleton inside my body. Neither me nor the doctors know how it got inside of me and I'm now being investigated for potentially trying to hide a crime (which I'm not!!). They found the skeleton to possibly belong to a white male in his mid 30's. The doctors said the skeleton might have been there for quite some time, as you could clearly see the white in the bones, pointing towards an advanced stage of decay. According to the prosecution, only excavation of the bones could provide further explanation. For this, they must first be removed from my body during a major surgical intervention. Afterwards, the true cause of death will be determined during a full post mortem of the skeleton. Any ideas how I ended up with a skeleton inside of my body?",morph113,shittyaskscience

Iron smell (seemingly random?),"Hi all, 
  Hoping to get some advice on something that's been plaguing me for 3 days straight. For some reason in a few specific places(scratch this too, it's turning random- anywhere I go it can smell like iron, outside or inside) it smells like iron for me. Everyone else seems fine, but it smells like iron's being wafted right in front of me. I can't smell it at home, or when I'm inside a building. (Scratch this out, I'm in a building and in a room and can smell it coming from somewhere). But for example, say when I get off a bus and turn a corner, it smells like iron. I walk down a street and around halfway it smells like iron and then stops a couple footsteps away. It's driving me insane- is it my nose? Or is it actually the air that stinks? It started 3 days ago I haven't smelled it in the air before this, and I have no idea how or why I can smell it- I don't even really know WHAT it is. Please help me out here, I searched it up online but they keep saying it's AC problems when I'm nowhere near an AC and I'm outside, either that or I have cancer. 
Is it from a chemical that was sprayed by an airplane or is it just me appearing as a phantom smell? 

Things I've tried 
- Gone up to iron bars/things that were near me when the smell hit me&amp; smelled them (they weren't giving off any scent)
- Tried following the smell to see if it was coming from somewhere(the smell stops after a few steps in either direction)
- was I having a really slight nosebleed? (checked &amp; ruled out)

Whenever a liberal says something stupid. Just use this copypasta,"
Thank you for your post. This is why the democrats act the way they do. A significant chunk of their base is completely removed from reality and has been trained to distrust any story or news source critical of their party.

They call fox a partisan tabloid and claim the right is obsessed with conspiracy theories while trusting openly-left-wing news sources and ignoring that all available data shows that conspiracies are significantly more popular on the left

(such as russia. And racist conspiracy theory that the president of the United States is a secret Russian agent. or the weird conspiracy theories that the Earth is going to completely crumble into dust and New York City will be thousands of feet underwater if you don't stop charging your iPod. are conspiracy theories that the Koch brothers somehow run the world even though it's been proven through documents that people like George Soros literally pay people to start protests. And of course other conspiracy theories like the wage Gap. Or this mystical patriarchy)

We live in completely different worlds. Our fundamental assumptions and facts do not line up and you have been told to distrust any source I could give you that might prove this

because its probably part of a “faux right wing news” conspiracy that targets your “side.” You live in a media bubble that claims any opposition from basically any angle is fake and untrustworthy and all part of ""a vast right-wing conspiracy"" against you .

You would only trust a handful of discredited Outlets. And even some of the left-wing ones but disagree with you you claim to be Russian agents

Its brilliant. But unfortunately it means we can’t even agree on basic facts in many cases.

"If Lake Ontario ceases to exist (or if I fill it in with soil, whatever comes first), will winter weather in Western New York state improve?","In Rochester NY, we have some of the cloudiest, gloomiest winters in America. Most weather websites will confirm this, and it's because of Lake Ontario's down-wind weather effects that make everything worse. Our worst snowstorms are caused ""lake-effect"" snow, and the cloud formations are primarily caused by the lake. 
Do we even need that lake? We can't even swim in it in the summer due to toxic algae levels. Forget that freshwater ecosystem! 
There's no way in hell I could ever get away with filling in the lake realistically. Hypothetically though, would removing the lake cause overall weather to improve in the Rochester region? I wonder what the ecological effect would be. What if we applied this idea to all the Great Lakes too?
Or maybe, is there a way to redirect our bad weather upwind to hit Toronto in the north? They get all the benefit of a lake without any of the weather consequences, and I think they've had it too good for too long. :(",svanvalk,shittyaskscience

Equation to Calculate TIME TILL EJACULATION (IT WORKS),"**The TTE Papers**

My Colleagues have spent hours developing a general equation for estimating the TTE (Time to Ejaculation) in a sexual experience with a woman. Note this formula is NOT appropriate for evaluating the TTE/ Hotness of Men and is also not applicable to situations with multiple women. It accounts for purely vaginal sex and any further contributions to our cause would be deeply appreciated. We invite both women and other sexually orientated individuals to develop their theories and formulae for the good of humanity. Please feel free to evaluate our theory so it can be improved.

The first variable we must consider is Hotness. Hotness is defined by the formula:

Hotness = \[ (Converted cup size x (1.5x hip to waist ratio)) / Inverted Facial Beauty\] + Experience variable 

In order to calculate these values, you will need their associated Conversion Tables presented here.

Cup Size Conversion Table

  

Cup Size Converted Values 

 

A - 2

 

B - 3

 

C - 4

 

D - 5

 

E - 5

 

F - 4

 

G - 3

Hip to Waist Ratio

This is a value calculated by the operation: 

Hip diameter (cm) / Waist size (cm)

Inverted Facial Beauty

Subjective Scale from 1 to 2 with 1 being the highest possible score and 2 being the lowest (fractional answers are allowed)

Experience Variable

If the girl in question is a seasoned veteran simply add 1 to her score.

Now that Hotness is calculated we can calculate arousal, our secondary unknown variable.

This is determined by the equation:

Arousal = Time of Foreplay x Strength of Foreplay (Hotness variable)

Here are the tables for calculating these variables.

Time of Foreplay  (Mins) Converted Values

 

1 - 0.5

 

2.5 - 1

 

5 - 1.5

 

10 - 2

 

15 - 2

 

20 - 1.5

 

30 - 1

 

60 - 0.5

  

Strength of Foreplay - Converted Values 

 

Nothing - 1

 

Light Kissing - 2

 

Make Out - 3

 

Asset Evaluation - 4

 

Full Asset Evaluation/Operation - 5

TTE Equation

Time to Ejaculation (Min) = 1000(Diameter of Vagina (cm)/ Arousal x Hotness)

Thesis Defence and Worked Examples

Hotness variable evaluation

First, I address cup Size. Bigger isn’t always better, hence at the end of the scale the score begins to dip again. Hip to Waist Ratio is far better than an evaluation of pure size to make a fair playing field for women of all heights and sizes. Facial Beauty is likely the weakest part of theory as it is entirely subjective. 

Arousal Theory Evaluation 

Arousal is affected by Hotness and therefore it is a multiplying factor in the equation. Duration is quite hard to evaluate however we concluded that around 10-15 mins is optimal. With a dip at the start to account for short foreplay and a dip at the end to account for boredom. Strength of Foreplay is denoted by the severity of the actions in question and is directly attributed to much of Arousal Value.

Time to Ejaculation Theory Evaluation

A smaller Vaginal diameter is better and therefore it is on top of the equation.

In the last two weeks, 2 of our cats have disappeared where when we went to put them up, they weren't around. And then we didn't see them again.  
Unfortunately we are guessing some wild animal probably got them :(.

What is life," 

As the trees tickled her face she giggled. Melinda was walking in the forest, feet tickling her feet. That was the thing, she was in a feet forest. All trees were feet. The grass was feet. The animals were feet too. It was a crisp January morning; the stench of the feet was strong in Linda’s dry nostrils. Her grandmother had cooked a pleasant, fluffy foot pancake that morning, with extra salty butter, and marzipan. Melinda loved marzipan, it was like almond cows milking her tongue on an array of sugary factory chocolates. Melinda was now in the foot forest, but she could still taste the foot pancakes in her still sweet mouth. Melinda was tall, around 5’9, and had never met anyone in the world except for her small, feeble grandmother. They lived pleasantly in a little foot shack on the foot forest in a house with no mirrors. No other person had ever stepped foot in the house other than Melinda and her grandmother. Melinda’s grandmother was a tall woman, with no foot-like aura and no footly essence. She loved her grandmother, and she loved her shack. But the foot forest, however, was getting dull. Melinda wanted to get out, and see what was beyond the field of feet which surrounded her dowdy shack. One day, Melinda decided enough was enough. She snuck to the basement and got her Windows 98, and opened [AOL.com](http://aol.com/). On AOL, she found a human man, named Brad. 

“Hello, I am Brad,” said Brad. 

Brad asked Melinda about her life, and every detail about it. He was astounded that she had never seen a man before, or for that matter, any woman or person who wasn’t her grandmother. But even more astounded Brad was to learn she had never seen herself.

“Wow,” brad said, with pure astonishment besetting his text. “When I come, I must fetch a mirror to reflect thy face for your eyes bro.”

Melinda was leaving? She was surprised, she didn’t see this coming. But it was time, she needed to get out. It was time for her to leave the foot forest. 

As the trees tickled her face she giggled. Melinda was walking in the forest, feet tickling her feet. It was a crisp January morning; the stench of the feet was strong in Melinda’s dry nostrils. Then she saw him: Brad, a tall man with manly features. She had never seen a man before. But the second Brad saw her, he was like “what the fuck dude you don’t look like I imagined bro” and ran away. Melinda was heartbroken, but she saw that Brad had left a small object on the ground from where he ran. Just then, her grandmother came out of the house and saw Melinda picking up the mirror. Melinda’s eyes widened as she saw herself in the mirror. 

“NO” screamed her grandmother, as Melinda finally realized what she was all along: a foot.",forkyougenerator,shittyaskscience

quantifying karma with bi-ology?? [just judging--the study of duality],"Could we have mistranslated the prefix of biology? Instead of biO defined by the orgasm, a new Bi-ology (ruled by systematic +/- feedback loops) could unite the study of life and death; religion and philosophy;

chemical (nucleotide) with physical (DNA string) science; 

probabilistic determinism with moral relativism (good/bad karma); 

and brain (auto-mechanistic action potentials and singularity of God) with microbiome (multiplicity of God) axis.

Also, could consumption of/violence towards life forms be quantified or at least put in relativistic terms? Something like;

karmic scale of beverages:

(negative) beer microbes&lt;tea leaves&lt;Bean/fruit juice&lt;water (\~neutral)&lt;kombucha (positive)

my reasoning \[context being key\] goes like: 

Fermented alcohol contains both living and dead yeast (fungal) cells so consumption requires at least some complacency towards slaughter. That being said, the nutrients within yeast could be beneficial for the microbiome (depends on the brewing process). 

Bean/fruit juice and tea requires the harvest/farming of plants or beneficial nutrients for the microbiome. so the karma could be negative or positive. 

Water is closest to neutral in terms of consumption yet beneficial for the body to maintain a baseline health. 

Kombucha requires consumption of bacteria (negative karma) however it's farther removed from our animal phylum compared to yeast so maybe it's not quite so bad (scary term imo). Furthermore, the microbes in kombucha can be assimilated into the body and improve our microbiome's vitality aka scientific spirituality (will the real slim shady please stand up?)

So I'm 29 and I have drank at least a 6 pack to a 12 pack of beer every evening after work since I was about 16 or 17.  I've wanted to quit or slow down but didn't find time.      But a little over a month ago I got way hotter at work than normal and it made me sick for about 3 days . (Which has never happened) and In those 3 days I didn't drink. When I felt ready to drink again I couldn't get more than one down without feeling sick, almost like dehydrated feeling.  I feel good not to have been drinking in the past month but im still feeling drained and sometimes sick no matter how much water or Gatorade I drink and even if I drink a beer now I get  really sick.   So my question is did I really hurt myself getting too hot? Or could it be something else? Is this something I should worry more about?   I've tried vitamins and stuff nothing is working.

Is something like the Sharingan from Naruto biologically possible?," 

I tried posting this elswhere but it got removed, I'm sure there was a reason so I'm cool with it.

Throwaway cause I don't want to seem like a weeb; for those of you who have not watched Naruto, this is what this ability does

&amp;#x200B;

The sharingan is basically an eye that changes ''shape'' under stress (hatred in the show) to grant new abilities.

Eye of sight

High stress will active an organ that senses energy-chackra-electricity like the movements from heartbeats or any other vibration caused by biologic beings, so you could sense animals and people.

The user under the effect of special hormones will process sight faster, have increased memory speed and the brain will try to predict the future with fast probability calculations based on experiences , like many modern computers do.

This allows the sharingan user to somehow see the possible futures, read lips and mimic things instantly.

The eye has many hidden membranes that can cover the eye to increase the focus power and achieve the ability to see at ''cellular level''.

Eye of Hypnosis (I'm sure this is impossible but I'm no doctor so what do I know)

A sharingan user can choose to release special ''spores'' in the air that can reach the brain of other organisms through the respiratory system.

Those spores can control neurons of the victim and make them do a set of actions they were created for. But, when the set of actions is finished the ''spores'' will stop working and be dissolved to leave no prints or proofs, so it will need new spores with different sets of actions.

these special ''spores'' can also cause blindness or loss of other senses on the victims like the Mangekyō Sharingan evolution.

Another more realistic but less precise system would be releasing a special pheromone in the air or an hormone that makes victims do what you tell, but they have to understand your language, so both hormones would work only with humans or a specific animal while the spores are almost universal.",MoistEchidna,shittyaskscience

Thunder Storm Stopped Time in One Room Only,"A few weeks ago we had a really bad lightning storm and the power went out for about 45 minutes. 

This is really strange so I'd appreciate any feedback.

* All of my other devices in other rooms stayed in the present
* My clock in the bedroom thought it was noon once the power came back on
* I know it went back to noon that day because all of our stuff was still in the room. So it wasn't before the building was built or when previous tenants occupied the room. Also, I waited 3 hours to see if the sheets moved and they didn't. I troubleshoot for a living so I'm very smart at this kind of thing. 
* If I went into the bedroom with my phone and checked my phone, I was in the present but the clock was still in the past

Eventually, I was able to hack my clock and change the time so that it thinks it's in the present again. However, I don't know if it's actually in the present. Again, I shoot trouble. 

The ONLY thing I can't figure out is that before I hacked my clock if me holding my phone (a time device) tethered me to the present even though the rest of the room was in the past. 

Any input would be appreciated. Serious responses only!",Russian_Ultron,shittyaskscience

The act of Observation/Measurement is the request of quantum wave information to Spacetime,"You make a request by setting something that can analyze the particle during its life/path. You are saying you want the particle to be real/physical.

**Double slit interpretation:**

Randomly shot particles are shot through a double slit, if no one places a detector in the path of the particle, the unobserved particle will be in the form of two waves (one for each slit) . Depending on the which wave ends up with more energy (after the split) ..the final position of a channel representing a fringe will be the final resting place of the now collapsed particle. If the energy wasn't unbalanced, I would expect to see only a single channel of fringe be filled in.

Now a detector gets placed anywhere along the path between the cannon and the final landing screen. The particle shot will immediately collapse upon leaving the cannon because the type of life that particle has, has already been decided. It won't be waves, just a particle. It's been pulled from the unobserved quantum realm and made physical in spacetime. It will go through one slit and hit the final screen in a normal clump.

If you accept this interpretation ..then you accept a particle being either a particle or waves ..not both at the same time.

You now also know that placing a detector in an experiment is a request from a human to the dimension of unobserved qm to swap quantum waves into something physical.

Observation is then a property of spacetime.

General Relativity = Spacetime = the theory of the large scale

Unobserved QM = Waves = the theory of the small scale

They are both dimensions in the same domain

Observation is then a request to bring an object from one dimension to the other. Boom, unified.",pittsburghjoe,shittyaskscience

I read about a guy who died when he fell of his canoe and he inhaled a little bit of water.

How probable is it that any part of us was part of a dinosaur's butthole at some point?,"Right, so the way I see it, matter is indestructible, and a majority of the matter that comprises a dead organism (such as, for a completely random example, the matter comprising the butthole) will be recycled by plants, animals, and other organisms, while a minority of the matter will be exhaled as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and blown away in the solar wind.

Non-avian dinosaurs have existed on this planet for over 150 million years, whereas anatomically modern humans have existed for less than a million. The matter in dinosaur bodies (at least, the ones which weren't buried under sediment and fossilized) must have been recycled millions of times.

Thus, I refer you to the question in the title. Are we all dinosaur buttholes on this blessed day? Am I all dinosaur buttholes on this blessed day?

Pretend you are in a minivan, you have a geolocated (GPS) drone (like a dji mavic or other). Now you lift off in the truck when you have all your satellites. Now the minivan goes forward 1mph mile/hour. Since the drone does not move (it's on GPS), then it will move back in the van to keep its original location. Windows are all closed so the wind is not a factor. Now I press forward on my drone remote to go 1mph like the van. Then the van accelerates to 30mph. So, to keep up with the van, should I go 30mph with the drone? Will it slam into the windshield?

1. The Hydra starts with 1 head. You cut it off, thinking that will kill it.

2. It grows 2 heads. This has to happen in a matter of seconds, or the Hydra doesn't really pose any threat.

3. In order to metabolize nutrients quickly enough to grow 2 heads, it would produce a combustive amount of heat.

4. The secret to killing a Hydra is to set it on fire. A Hydra's quickly multiplying heads would cause it to catch on fire.

How do I turn bottled water into regular water?,"Many companies put water into bottles because people think that makes it better and so they can be charged a surplus, but I don't like the taste of plastic and would rather not have to eat the bottle to get to the water. I was thinking about getting an antimatter bottle and putting them together and maybe they'd cancel out and leave me with the water, but I'm no physicist so I don't know how to get an antimatter bottle. When I went to my friend with these concerns, he just told me that I was stupid and should just pour the water out of the bottle. I am not quite sure what this means but it seems to have something to do with getting the water *out* of the bottle somehow? The bottle is sealed though so I don't know how to do that. It seems it would be easier to remove the bottle, but when I tried using a vegetable peeler, the water spilled everywhere.

Double-Slit experiment question,"I’m no scientist, I just enjoy reading up on random science related things, so please bare with my question if it comes across stupid haha.

I’m using this just as an example ,but I’ve always wondered if this is why someone who is unaware that they have cancer, goes to a doctor for a check up, the doctor notices something unusual and decides to make an observation, thus causing the cancer cells to spread faster once observed. It always feels as if, as soon as someone is diagnosed with cancer and they are now aware that they have cancer their health seems to deteriorate faster once they are aware that they have cancer.

Another thing is, say every living creature that has ever existed since the Big Bang was born with no eyes what would exist around us, if we cannot observe anything then we would not be causing any disruption to the waves of light emitted from objects?

So from my understanding with the double slit experiment is that, as soon as we observe something this can create a random result?",Endzman,shittyaskscience

Dumbest mystery ever - The Wiggly Microwave Clock,"So I have noticed that when I am looking at the LED display clock on my microwave, and happen to be chewing/eating, that the numbers appear to jiggle and bounce up and down with each crunch. The numbers appear to bounce separately from each other, in that the any number can bounce higher/lower than the others, almost as if all the numbers were jumping up and down simultaneously, but at different rates so they look all jumbled.

Just my eyes getting jostled by chewing, right?

The mystery is: when I look at the LED display clock on my oven, or other devices, while chewing... the numbers don't move AT ALL.

I had my wife perform the same experiment (we used pretzels) and she confirmed my findings.

Can anyone shed any light on how this could be?

I happened to see a black triangle fly over my house, clearly larger than 2 houses, clearly military with a big search light on one corner hitting the streets. You're not going to c","Imagine you're on a Jumbo Jet airplane and suddenly all the engines stop working, what happens next? Well .... the next thing that happens is that all these bags drop out of the ceiling and you HAVE TO PUT THEM ON, and they make you stoned within seconds so you pass out. Ever wondered why these masks exist? Why is it necessary to sedate airline passengers?

Consider: In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines fail, only one jet engine is required stay in the air! There is no explanation yet from Boeing or NASA as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating on ONE (not both) wings. Remember the movie Memphis Belle (1990)? Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn’t the plane immediately drop to one side? What about the real life examples where \*ALL\* engines  failed and the massive plane was able to turn 180 degrees and return safely to the ground? (Read: Miracle on the Hudson cited at the end of the OP for an example). Have to agree after the last few crashes that something mysterious is failing within these planes, right? I mean, it's not an led light that's the problem here.

The Big Secret: Electromagnetic technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\\\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Allied bombing raids using child pilots is the inspiration behind the book Ender's Game. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. Had the allies used normal anti gravity technology to win the war, they would have sent the Memphis Belle boys in flying saucers. The pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and we'd all be in our own saucers today.

The only reason to build an airplane that could never fly by aerodynamic technology alone \*IS\* to hid the technology from the very pilots who are winning the Allies war. Can you agree that saturated air bombing won WW2? All those houses in that movie The Pianist? 67 Cities in Japan, etc etc. This is how we won WW2. We CHEATED! This is how NAZI Germany, North Korea, Japan (and more recently) Vietnam and Yugoslavia were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 \*YEARS\*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes since 2014). This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

Q: No seriously, WHY are you doing this?

A: If you can't tell, there is a serious epidemic of censorship destroying the internet we used to know. A big part of the problem lies in the arrogance of those privileged enough to still be on these networks. Until we get our rights back (ALL OF US), your caged safe zones will continue to rattle

But isnt this just a choice we've made ?

Obviously the Sun has the biggest mass so it tends to impact more than other planets on the orbits - but doesnt every planet and moon affect other planets and moons ?  Plus is there really a center to the solar system when everything actually travel the universe at a crazy speed ?

Basically am I wrong thinking heliocentrism is just a choice of referential we've made to make calculations easier ; but geocentrism could also be a valid choice, though less practical ?

I've spent hundreds of dollars on it at drug dens called 'grocery stores' over the course of my life and I hear even the government advertises it.

I don't want to be a junkie anymore and I've tried weaning myself off of it, but the withdrawal is too powerful and I feel like I'm gonna die! I even tried substituting it with all natural thing like rocks, but to no avail.

Why do I need a phenomenally huge dick to work as a scientist?,"So this isn't exactly a science question but more about the field of working in science, I hope that it's still appropriate for this sub.

I've been lurking on this sub for a while now and learning a lot about science. I've decided that I've got so good at it, I should try to do it as a career. I don't specialize in any particular kind of science but I'm an expert in general in anything anyone can ask. However when I look at job requirements such as working as a chemist or physicist they always require that the person applying has a phenomenally huge dick. I wasn't sure how large this was so for several jobs I applied and said I had one. However when they asked about my phenomenally huge dick and I dropped my pants, I guess they decided my dick wasn't huge enough and told me I wouldn't be a good fit for the job and asked me to leave.


Is there anyway to improve the size of my dick or are there any jobs in science that do not require a phenomenally huge dick? I think this is unfair as my knowledge of the subject matter should be the primary concern for those hiring me, but this is always the very first and most important subject that they bring up whenever I try to apply for any research position. Besides, I've seen several female scientists. How do women become scientists when they can't possible have a phenomenally huge dick? Maybe I can fulfill the requirements the same way they do? I do not like the boring job I currently have and I'm looking to pursue my dreams of becoming a scientist. Any advice would be deeply appreciated.",xman720,shittyaskscience

Is my thought process about airplanes proof that the Earth cannot be flat?,"Airplanes use a huge amount of fuel to get up in the air, but once they are up there, they can throttle back and fly great distances while using very little fuel. This oddity is because as the fuel is used to move the plane forward, gravity pulls the plane down, causing air to rush under the wings pushing the plane upwards a little bit. If the earth is flat, that little bit of upward push would not be enough to keep the plane in the sky, and more fuel would have to be used to keep the plane constantly lifting off. But if the Earth is curved (like a ball) as gravity pulls the plane downward, the little bit of lift is enough to keep the plane up, because the earth's surface is falling away from the plane at the same rate that the lift is failing to keep the plane flying in a straight line out into space. This keeps the plane at a constant distance from the Earth's surface, and therefore needs very little fuel to move forward, since it is always falling toward earth, but that causes enough lift to keep it up there.",slowshot,shittyaskscience

At what temperature is water the happiest?,"As we all know from science, water here on earth freezes at around 0°C / 32°F and reaches it's boiling point at about 100°C / 212°F.
 
Temperatures above or below these thresholds fundamentally change the nature of water, making it either become ice or steam.

The way these changes manifest in water (bubbling, boiling, freezing up) lets us deduce that they cause a severe level of discomfort or maybe even pain to the the liquid itself. 
We can therefore conclude that Water, that is either at (or close) to boiling or freezing, is significantly unhappy. So far, this is, what we, as scientists can all agree on. 

What temperature would be the most comfortable for water though? Would it be the exact half-way-point between freezing and boiling? I have not come across any evidence to support this claim though. Maybe there is something I'm overlooking. What do you think?",Pesoho,shittyaskscience

EMERGENCY HOLE TO CHINA UPDATE: I'M IN JAIL IN THE CENTER OF THE EARTH,"Original post from six years ago here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/ol1gz/im_digging_a_hole_to_china_how_long_is_this_going/

u/roobarb_pie (or anyone else), PLEASE HELP ME. I've now dug far enough to meet the Bull of Divine Wisdom as you warned me about in [your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/ol1gz/im_digging_a_hole_to_china_how_long_is_this_going/c3i5507/), but laws at the center of the Earth must have changed since then, because he didn't cast me back into the land-sky, he fucking threw me in jail. And I only got ONE of his riddles wrong.

Does anyone know any center-of-the-Earth bondsman? Can anyone come get me? I've only got one phone call and they're only going to let me re-check this Reddit post 24 hours from now, and they only have dial-up internet down here. I think I'm kinda fucked. I'm also hot and very hungry, but all they give us to eat down here is Arby's.

The riddle I got wrong wasn't even a riddle, either. It was a question -  ""How are you?"" and I answered, ""I'm okay. Digging kinda sucks."" But for some reason the correct answer was ""Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff."" I've argued a lot about this already, and I'm exhausted. The Bull of Divine Wisdom is actually insane, someone please help me. :(

&gt;The problem is that gravity is really weak. State of the art experiments are done by dropping a ball in a vacuum and measuring the fall time with a laser. If you put a very heavy object above the ball, the fall will be a tiny bit slower due to gravity. The accuracy is then limited by the mechanical, electrical and optical parts - how precise is the time measurement. If the heavy weight changes the time by a factor of 1e-6, and you can measure the time to 10 significant digits accuracy, you have 4 digits left to compute G.

Is there a size of wire that wouldn't be able to conduct electricity because it were too big?,"So, ohm's law says I = V/R which means that the lower the resistance of the wire, the higher the current will be. We also know that we can lower the resistance by making the wire bigger.

I'm wondering if there's a size of wire so big that you couldn't conduct electricity through it, just because the wire was so big that the current would just get diluted in the massive wire, and how big would that wire be?

Ok, so say you have a 12V 3A light bulb connected to a battery with 10AWG wire. 

Then you splice in an enormously thick wire. How thick would the wire you splice in have to be before the light bulb would cease to light up? Or would it ever?

Also assume you have infinite insulation around the wire for practical purposes.",zwhitchcox,shittyaskscience

Each Male has on average 2 testicles and one penis (hereby referred to as ‘wang/s’). 

So my question is, if alien life exists, do you think they know that 7 billion testicles and 3.5 billion wangs are hurtling around a giant ball of gassy plasma in the middle of bumfuck nowhere?

Could Dark Energy be stored potential energy in black holes?,"Now this is going to be a long one, sorry mobile.

We all know what black holes are, a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. (Wikipedia)

1. Black Holes are big bombs of potential energy but they never seem to 'Go off'.

2. They decay but like a balloon that your tieing, you can't tie it without letting some air out or heat and radiation out. After 'tieing' the black hole it would still act as a '4th dimensional' balloon holding all that potential energy as something we can't see Dark Energy, but with that it's a '4th dimension' so you could still interact with the space in it and with that expading are universe, Dark Holes.

3. Dark Holes would explain Einstein's theory that space can have energy.

4. Last but not least, Dark Holes like balloons are attracted towards electricity or themselves in which creates electricity. That electricity creates a Dark Matter that can interact with our universe, a galaxy moving faster than its matter counterpart would suggest.

A star 300 times the mass of the sun starts creating metal, it is a death sentence. Before exploding the matter at the center of the star gets so hot and so condensed it has to go somewhere. A star is a balloon, condensed gas, but this star doesn't pop. It breaks space-time just a tiny bit, just enough to let some of that matter out creating a 'reverse ballooning' effect, a black hole has formed. Pulling everything and anything else into it. 
After the star and solar system, hypothetical after many years and nothing going into, it would start to close releasing a heat and radiation but just a little in comparison to what its got. Remember, nothing can escape it. It disappears expanding are universe but it's still in universe.

In addition, in order to add airbags to the wing, the delta wing may have to be changed to a four-corner wing!

When the aircraft begins to take off, let the buoy at the front of the aircraft be slightly higher than the buoy at the rear of the aircraft! During the flight, put the buoy into the cabin of the aircraft.

When the aircraft surf on the water surface, open the air bag!When the aircraft leaves the water surface, throw away the air bag or discharge the gas in the airbag.

In the place outside the cabin of the warship slightly above the water, set some cabin doors, preferably sealed doors! When not flying, put these aircrafts in the cabin of the warship!

Keep the landing gear of the aircraft, so that the aircraft can crawl in the cabin of the warship!In this way, when the water plane is about to take off, can it climb from the cabin of the warship to the surface of the water?After the water plane landed, could it sail back into the cabin of the warship?

Besides, is the performance of airbag water skiing good?Can air bags be used instead of buoys?If the buoys could be replaced, how much would the weight and volume of the water plane be larger than that of the existing carrier aircraft?

Is there any technical obstacle to such a carrier aircraft?Is the feasibility of designing such a carrier aircraft very low?

What is the construction cost of such a carrier aircraft?Compared with the existing carrier based aircraft, what is the difference in combat effectiveness?

Can you tell me specifically about such a water plane like I say, at what level of wind and waves can it take off and land?Ha-ha!

In this way, the existing aircraft carriers can be eliminated, can't they? So, do you think people in the past had brain disabilities? Ha-ha!",chinese_loser,shittyaskscience

Does Ben Stiller Like Pasta?,"&lt;asking for a friend?&gt;

On one hand, Pasta is a popular dish. On the other, I've never witnessed Ben Stiller eating Pasta - furthermore, one must consider that gluten allergies are fairly common. I don't believe Ben Stiller is Italian, but his father Jerry Stiller played Frank Costanza on Seinfeld, which sounds very Italian. But then again, one must consider that Ben really just looks like a side salad kind of guy. But it's all speculation at this point.

What do you think? If you wore Ben Stiller's skin would you enjoy a steaming plate of Alfredo? Angel hair slathered in butter and garlic sauce? Would you eat the Pasta from a can or a bowl? A plate?? Would you not eat Pasta at all and instead save yourself for garlic bread and desert? A can of peaches doesn't sound bad, you must admit.

If Ben Stiller, in a theoretical reality wherein he does *not* eat Pasta, were threatened with mild physical harm, would be suck it up and eat that plate of macaroni?

Would he eat pasta in a dirty restaurant? Wouldn't the presence of a non-Pasta Stiller be a detriment to his acting range - say, in a film where the scene requires him to eat the Pasta? What does this say about Non Pasta Eaters everywhere?

If anyone has documentary evidence either way, say a picture of Ben Stiller eating Pasta, or one where he maybe pushes away a plate of Pasta in apparent disgust, that would be even better.",names_notrick,shittyaskscience

"Can someone please peer review my manuscript: ""The science behind coupon wealth and how we can eliminate worldwide poverty by 2019""? Extensive research inside.","The Science behind coupon wealth and how we can eliminate worldwide poverty by 2019

Written by me

The age old question of poverty has always been ""Poverty sucks!"" but what if we could, like, stop it?  Studies show nearly 97% of coupons, which are freely printed without oversight from the Illuminati, are valued at 1/100th of a penny.  

After 3 months of grueling calculations, my research shows that 100 coupons are valued at 1 penny.  Through economies of scale,  a collection of 10,000,000,000 coupons are valued at 1 million dollars.

So if we simply begin printing more coupons, we can eliminate worldwide poverty by the end of the year.  

There is one caveat however, in that my research shows old people really fucking love coupons, and there is a small possibility that by increasing coupon output, we may inadvertently create a population of ultra mega elite old people who use their power for evil, subjugating us further.

Face shaving,"I recently saw a [post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ShakeMyBeauty/videos/250595038973466/) with a video of a lady with a hefty beard.

I'm interested as to how this lucky woman grew such a luscious beard and I, (M, 21), cannot seem to grow any more facial hair than Johnny Depp in [The Ninth Gate.](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/4600000/The-Ninth-Gate-the-ninth-gate-4680175-900-600.jpg)  


I need to get to the bottom of this issue, as I am deeply emotionally, physically &amp; spiritually threatened by this display of hairy dominance.

&amp;#x200B;

I have hypotheses:

1. That shit isn't a woman and she knows it.
2. Increased hormones - if so, why does it seem my beard will never be impressive as hers?
3. The wrath of God - if God exists, then why did he curse me with such sparse facial hair?
4. Genetics.
5. She mentioned she started shaving every day when the facial hair started coming out (presumably at the start of puberty) due to embarrassment. I've always wondered whether shaving really often increases facial hair growth, thickness &amp; density, since when I started getting a hairy face at the age of 15 I found I didn't need to shave every day until I was about 18.

If this isn't shitty enough science, I could post this in r/shaving or something.

At the same time im adding a ludicrous aspect of someone being fill from their teeth to their anus with steel media so maybe this is the perfect place

There was also another post on the front page about having 24 hours to eat a couch for a large sum of money, where a large number of threada broke down into the problems of what happens when you start putting pieces of metal into your body....

So now in some kind of Frankenstein's Monster of a post, I'm combining them to ask....in as depth detail as you would like to go....for a super slow-mo of what would happen the minute you activated a super strong electro-magnet that just so happened to be surrounded someone filled full of tiny steel(we will eliminate copper BBs so they are guaranteed magnetic) ball bearings

Her argument is that they remove the Turkey’s butthole in the butchering process. This simply makes it bread inside a turkey’s body. I say that in removing the butthole, they’re just making a bigger butthole.

Quantum theory(joke) (interesting joke) hmmm,"Have you heard of the Quantum Theory? No?  Great!! Because I'm here to tell you all about it. The Quantum Theory basically takes Quantum physics onto a whole new level, let's talk about quantum physics first: scientists have recently found out that atoms have there own type of physics, which could mean there's an active living civilization in each atom. I'm here to make more sense of the Quantum Theory and make it more understandable, so we've went over how atoms have there own physics, and how there could be an active full fledged civilization in each atom, now I'm going to be talking about how we ourselves could be living in an atom right now, so, we have our own physics that we've studied very well, and we also managed to find out that atoms have there own physics, so we consider ourselves the top tier species that have ruled the earth so far, since we are much bigger than atoms, and we may be living in atoms, could there be other ""big"" people that are seeing us as atoms but have there own physics? With other ""bigger"" people and more and more, it never ends its an infinite loop, infact this might be wrong, we might be the largest living civilization, but we might not be as well.

In first transition series electron filling up processes begins in the 3d level below a filled 4S² level. During ionization process will a 4S electron or a 3d electron be lost first ? Explain with reference to Chromium.," 

[Electronic Configuration](https://www.priyamstudycentre.com/2018/08/the-structure-of-atom.html) of Chromium : 1S² 2S² 2P⁶ 3S² 3p⁶ 3d⁵ 4S¹.

Screening constant (σ) for 4S electron is : 

σ = (2 × 1.0) + (8 × 1.0) + (8 × 0.85) + (5 × 0.85)= 21.05.

∴Effective nuclear charge = (24 - 21.05) = 2.95.

Screening constant (σ) for 3d electron is :   
σ = (2 × 1.0) + (8 × 1.0) + (8 × 1) + (4 × 0.35)= 19.4.  
∴Effective nuclear charge = (24 - 19.4) = 2.95.  
Hence a 3d electron is more tightly held than a 4S electron. So during ionization the 4S electron lost first.

I want to understand the science of what happens to these chemical compounds that I inhale, where do they go and end up sticking around. How do my lungs operate to clean, if they can, these compounds. I need to use cleaning products and high temperatures to get the resin out of the glass tubing of my vape, how do my lungs do it? Is it any different than evacuating bigger particulates, like fine dust for example? I mean in my layman's mind I see cells blobbing towards these tiny particles and just gobbling them away.

Published results of the testing aboard the Satellite of Love?,"Starting in 1988, Dr. Clayton Forrester and his colleague TV's Frank began a study of the effect of bad movies on a human test subject. For unknown reasons, it was deemed necessary to keep the test subject in low earth orbit aboard a satellite.

&amp;#x200B;

The initial 2 phases of the trial examined two test subjects, both white males. In a break of protocol, the test subject created a group of sentient robots to watch the movies with.

&amp;#x200B;

On November 22nd, it's expected we'll see the release of raw data for 6 more tests, this time conducted in a lab on the moon.

Can eating raw food help you lose weight? Raw foods are harder to digest and would cost more calories to digest.,"When you cook food you are basically aiding in your digestion because your body doesn't need to work as hard to digest the food. 

When someone eats raw food their bodies need to work harder to digest, using more calories. As a result the total calories from eating raw food is lower than total calories from eating the same food cooked.

Considering that weight loss is based on the concept of ""Calories in &lt; Calories out"" this could help achieve the goal. By being calorie inefficient.",Venousmeerkat,shittyaskscience

How is that the existence of buildings prior to the discovery of gravity doesn't confirm the use of alien tecnology to you?,"I have this chat with a lot of partners and academic friends. I once went to greece and, unless they are lying to attract tourist, they have a lot of buildings from before newton being born. 
Most of their buildings make sense to me, they are all down on the ground, cause they didn't know the stone will go done once put in the building, and it is all crushed. But others, they say, belong to the same age or to medieval times and are still standing.

How could they built a building that grows up to the air when they didn't know gravity existed, if not by following an alien recipe of some civilization that is aware of that fact? 

Is it posible that ancient civilizations knew about gravity, but its knowledge didn't get to us, and it was them who built all the places (but the parks, that i do believe were created by those Renaissance bitches) we now think belonged to the medieval, were in fact differents suburbs and the medieval civilizations were just occupying them?",awhatfor,shittyaskscience

[NSFW] Orgasm during vaginal sex?,"Alright, I apologize for the details, but its relevant. So first of all, I didn't ""tender the package before delivery"" at all. So we were getting intimate, and she asked if I had a condom.  We were planning vaginal sex, no hands involved, so I was definitely confused. I wasnt exactly in the mood for a biology lesson, so I just told her I was infertile. Shortly after we started, I began to feel the buildup. I pulled out and checked the area, just to make sure she wasnt using her hands, and she wasnt. I figured it was nothing, so I kept going, but orgasmed right after. I'm not sure if I ejaculated, as I was still inside, but what the hell? I wasnt masturbating, and after I did the initial check, I pinned her arms down pretending to be ""sexy"", so I knew she wasn't giving me a handjob.

He is also one of the biggest financial donors to Republicans in the country, and he donated over a million dollars to the Trump campaign. Furthermore, he was on Trumps transition team and was reportedly offered a position in the Trump administration.

If you follow that link, or decide to independently verify this on your own, you'll see that Peter Thiel is in the middle of a lot of things that the Mueller investigation is potentially looking at. He has business ties to the Kushners, and one of his corporate interests has a lot of employee crossover with Cambridge Analytica. That company ( Palantir ) should perk up everyone's interest, considering what it's doing and the fact its owner has a stake in Reddit.

I can't stress it enough that anyone who uses Reddit should familiarize themselves with Peter Thiel. He's not just a Republican, he's a billionaire activist. His political views are exactly what we're seeing in places like The_Donald, and many other far right wing political subs.

So the next time Spez says that The_Donald exists to give those users a platform to express themselves, consider that one of Spez's biggest ( if not the biggest ) financial backers is one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters and a Republican activist. As Lester Freemon would say, follow the money.

Everything that Reddit has done in regards to eliminating right wing extremism or state sponsored information warfare appears to be reactionary. There have been numerous instances where hundreds if not thousands of users submitted complaints and reports, and nothing is done until the sub in question generates negative publicity offsite. And in the case of The_Donald, it appears that no amount of negative publicity will make a difference........ That sub is untouchable.

For your consideration, ladies and gentlemen. Feel free to poke holes in my hypothesis.",H37man,shittyaskscience

One solution would be to restrict the posting on this subreddit and only limit it to a bot that copies the front page of the “r/askscience” subreddit and all the other minor ones like “r/askphysics”, etc.

How did they clone Gary Sinise?,"As we all know, midway through the filming of Forrest Gump, Gary Sinise had his legs amputated to play the role of Lieutenant Dan after he had his legs blown off in 'Nam.

https://i.imgur.com/QdUQiMX.jpg

The time it took for his legs to heal gave time for Tom Hanks to grow the beard for the running around America parts of the film, then the beard was shaved off, and made into a face merkin to be used later in the film (in the running scenes), so by the time the face merkin was made, Gary Sinise's legs had healed up and he could continue filming.

They also made him special legs, using metals used in the space shuttle. Some would call them magic legs.

https://i.imgur.com/Edm06zO.jpg
 
But as wee see, this has left him with a signifigant limp, and as such is forced to walk with a cane.

https://i.imgur.com/R9NHNnc.jpg

Following Forrest Gump, rather than paying for further expensive surgury to reattach Gary Sinise's legs, the studio decided it was more economic to euthanise the now disabled Gary Sinise and replace him with a clone, as is obvious from the fact that he has no scars from where the leg reattachment would have taken place.

https://i.imgur.com/8ce5i0k.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/hSYNKNy.jpg

So, my question is, how did they clone Gary Sinise? And is this the first time, or have there been other Gary Sinises?

Pasta,"What could cause my son to have a j-shaped penis? My son is 19 and though I have not seen him nude since he was a boy, I had seen him by accident about 6 months ago, when he had somehow ended up falling asleep naked in his room after a shower with his door wide open. He was on his back and erect in his sleep. I noticed his hard-on had a severe curve upward. It was bent very sharply like curling up backwards. I had never seen anything like that on any man. It is about 7″ long approximately and is bent more toward the tip in a definite shape of a letter “j”, or a hook, to attempt to describe it to you.

I was so shocked that I panicked, and woke him up right then and there. Thinking back, it was not very tactful, but I could not wait to try to get at what appeared to be a real problem. It all made sense, how he would not shower at gym class, and didn’t date, despite being a very well built and handsome boy into sports always. I had always wondered if might be gay, though he denied it always. He awoke surprised and shy that he was naked, but I moved his hands from his erect penis, and asked him what was the matter.

We sat and talked after locking his bedroom door. He told me it had started when he was like 12 and got worse, and as I examined it more closely and attempted to straighten it out, it would straighten only very slightly before it would hurt him to force it any further. It being erect, it was very hard and stiff. We allowed it to subside by him putting on his robe a while, and was considerably more normal in the soft state, yet still tending to be curved upwards slightly.

I could straighten it easily while soft, but it would bend back up like rubber. As he became erect again it curled up before my eyes into the “j” hook shape despite my trying to keep it straight. Sometimes it even curls while it is in my hands.

Now the doctors all said he is fine and it’s normal as far as being a medical issue. They said they could operate to attempt to fix it, but the cost was out of my reach. I am a single parent. So we took trying our own methods, in which I would tell him to stroke it straight whenever he thought about it, and while masturbating to attempt to work the curl out a little more each time.

I had taken a little massage therapy classes in the past, and I even work on it for an hour or so 3 days of every week in the evening. It was embarrassing for us both in the beginning and I know it still is me being his mother and all, and even more so that he ejaculates every time during the massage. It is really embarrassing for him when some of his ejaculate gets on my hands, but it turned out to make massaging it in the post-ejaculation, semi-soft state really effective because then I can massage it and straighten it. It curls back in my hands and I massage it straight over and over again, until he becomes erect again and semi hard again after ejaculation, three times in a row, usually over a span of an hour to an hour and a half.

It has given good results, as I would say he is 50 percent improved. I continue to treat him 3 days a week.

I am here to ask anyone with information on this condition for advice and/or tips technics on how we can further correct this.

Thank you all in advance.
