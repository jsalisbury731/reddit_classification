AskScience AMA Series: I'm Astronaut Terry Virts: An Insider who can tell you about leaving planet earth! Ask me anything!,"Hi Reddit, I'm Col. Terry Virts. I'm a former astronaut who commanded the International Space Station from 2014-2015. I also spent two weeks piloting the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 2010. During my time in space, I took more than 300,000 photos of earth, conducted hundreds of experiments, did everything from shooting an IMAX movie to replacing a crew mate's tooth filling! I also went on three spacewalks. I'm now a professional speaker, photographer, director, and author. My directorial debut documentary, *One More Orbit*, was released on VOD on Oct. 6 and my new book, *How to Astronaut: An Insider's Guide to Leaving Planet Earth* released on Sep. 15! From fighter jets to unwieldly space suits, space station cuisine, and an uncensored look at answering the call of nature in zero-g, ***HOW TO ASTRONAUT: An Insider's Guide To Leaving Planet Earth*** is a wildly entertaining collection of short essays that offers a primer for future space tourists with a sneak peek behind the curtain at the rules, lessons, procedures, and experiences of space travel.

I will start at 2pm Eastern (18 UT), ask me anything!

"Ask Anything Wednesday - Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science","Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3exo6p/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xiii/).

We are scientists from the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology coming to you from our annual meeting — which is virtual this year! We study fossils. Ask Us Anything!,"Hi /r/AskScience! We are members of the [**Society of Vertebrate Paleontology**](http://vertpaleo.org/), here for our 7th annual AMA. We study fossil fish, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles — anything with a backbone! Our research includes how these organisms lived, how they were affected by environmental change like a changing climate, how they're related, and much more. You can **follow us on Twitter @SVP_vertpaleo**.

Also, it's National Fossil Day in the US. Please join us in celebrating! Our experts today are:

- **Matt Borths, Ph.D.** (/u/Chapalmalania) is the Curator of Fossils at the [Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/) at Duke University in Durham, NC.

"AskScience AMA Series: We are scientists on the OSIRIS-REx mission, NASA's first mission to collect a pristine sample of an asteroid to return to Earth for future study. The first sample collection attempt is October 20. Ask us anything!","If you are traveling over 200 million miles to snag a sample of an asteroid, you want to make sure it's worth it. The following scientists are part of the OSIRIS-REx mission - NASA's first mission to collect a sample of an asteroid and return it to Earth. They have just published a collection of papers that confirm that asteroid Bennu - the target of OSIRIS-REx - is an ideal candidate to reveal clues about the origins of life in our solar system. These discoveries complete the OSIRIS-REx mission's pre-sample collection science requirements and offer insight into the sample of Bennu that scientists will study for generations to come.

 The discoveries tell us that Bennu:

+ Contains carbon-bearing, organic materials
+ Likely used to interact with water
+ Has a type of porous rock that would offer a new, unique perspective to our meteorite collections on Earth
+ Is made up of an interior not uniform in density
+ Contains ridge-like mounds that stretch from pole to pole and has differently shaped hemispheres
+ Has areas, including our sample site, that have not been exposed to a lot of space weathering

Read the press release on these discoveries: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2002/osiris-rex-unlocks-more-secrets-from-asteroid-bennu

Participants:

+ Michael Daly - York University/Canadian Space Agency
+ Daniella DellaGiustina - Image Processing Lead Scientist, University of Arizona
+ Jason Dworkin - Project Scientist for the OSIRIS-REx Mission, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
+ Hannah Kaplan - Research Space Scientist, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
+ Jay McMahon - University of Colorado Boulder
+ Benjamin Rozitis - The Open University, UK
+ Amy Simon - Planetary Scientist, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

Ask us about what we've already learned from Bennu and what we can learn from a sample of this asteroid! We'll be answering questions from **2 - 3pm ET (18 - 19 UT)**, ask us anything!.

"AskScience AMA Series: We're from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and from Washington Maritime Blue and DNV GL. Our organizations are working together to bring the safe use of hydrogen to these ports for a cleaner energy future. Ask away, we're here to answer your questions. AUA!","Hi Reddit, Happy National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day! We;re Jamie Holladay, David Hume, and Lindsay Steele from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Jennifer States from Washington Maritime Blue and DNV GL. Did you know the use of hydrogen to power equipment and ships at our nation's ports can greatly reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions? Did you know that the transportation sector contributes 29 percent of harmful emissions to the atmosphere-more than the electricity, industrial, commercial and residential, and agricultural sectors?

The nation's ports consume more than 4 percent of the 28 percent of energy consumption attributed to the transportation sector. More than 2 million marine vessels worldwide transport greater than 90 percent of the world's goods. On land, countless pieces of equipment, such as cranes and yard tractors, support port operations.

Those vessels and equipment consume 300 million tonnes of diesel fuel per year, produce 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emission, and generate the largest source of sulfur dioxide emissions.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and collaborators are looking at how we can help the nation's ports reduce energy consumption and harmful emissions by using hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel.

We've conducted a study with several U.S. ports to assess replacing diesel with hydrogen fuel cells in port operations.  We've done this through collection of information about equipment inventory; annual and daily use, power, and fuel consumption; data from port administrators and tenants; and satellite imagery to verify port equipment profiles. We crunched the data and found that hydrogen demand for the U.S. maritime industry could exceed a half million tonnes per year.

We are also seeking to apply our abundant hydrogen expertise to provide a multi-use renewable hydrogen system to the Port of Seattle-which will provide the city's utility provider with an alternative clean resource.

Our research is typically supported by the Department of Energy's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office.

We'd love to talk with you about our experiences and plans to connect our nation's ports to a hydrogen future. We will be back at noon PDT (3 ET, 19 UT) to answer your questions. AUA!

"Ask Anything Wednesday - Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology","Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."". 

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.

Where do the light waves go when you turn of the lights?,"This might sound like a joke, but I genuinely don't know the answer.

So, when you turn on the lights, the circuit closes and the lights turn on. The light bulb or whatever sends out beams of light, which are reflected and absorbed by objects. That's my understanding of it, though I might be wrong.

But what happens when you turn off the lights? I get the part that the circuit is interrupted and therefore the light bulb isn't sending out light anymore. But what about those light beams that are already bouncing around the room? Do they just disappear after a while? 

On a similar note, I've been taught that shade is where the light doesn't get to, since light isn't like sound in that the beams are straight and don't go in all directions. But you can still see something in the shadow, it's not just black. Everythings darker, but not completely black.

During those 5 years I’ve completed a masters and almost a PhD, so my mental performance doesn’t appear to be impacted. 

Everyone else in my lab claims they “cannot function” on less than 8 hours however people in the lab next door are similar to myself.

I wonder, what are the factors that dictate this requirement for sleep? Is it genetic or learned?",RichardsonM24,askscience

"Ask Anything Wednesday - Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology","Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

AskScience AMA Series: We're misinformation and media specialists here to answer your questions about ways to effectively counter scientific misinformation. AUA!,"Hi! We're misinformation and media specialists: I'm [Emily](https://twitter.com/saltzshaker), a UX research fellow at the Partnership on AI and First Draft studying [the effects of labeling media](https://www.partnershiponai.org/partnership-on-ai-first-draft-begin-investigating-labels-for-manipulated-media/) on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I interview people around the United States to understand their experiences engaging with images and videos on health and science topics like COVID-19. Previously, I led UX research and design for the New York Times R&amp;D Lab's [News Provenance Project](http://newsprovenanceproject.com/).

And I'm [Victoria](http://www.twitter.com/victoriakwan_), the ethics and standards editor at [First Draft](https://firstdraftnews.org/), an organization that develops tools and strategies for protecting communities against harmful misinformation. My work explores ways in which journalists and other information providers can effectively slow the spread of misinformation (which, as of late, includes a great deal of coronavirus- and vaccine-related misinfo). Previously, I worked at Thomson Reuters.

Keeping our information environment free from pollution - particularly on a topic as important as health - is a massive task. It requires effort from all segments of society, including platforms, media outlets, civil society organizations and the general public. To that end, we recently collaborated on [a list of design principles](https://medium.com/swlh/it-matters-how-platforms-label-manipulated-media-here-are-12-principles-designers-should-follow-438b76546078) platforms should follow when labeling misinformation in media, such as manipulated images and video. We're here to answer your questions on misinformation: manipulation tactics, risks of misinformation, media and platform moderation, and how science professionals can counter misinformation.

Is vacuum something that is conserved or that moves from place to place?,"Wife and I had a long, weird argument last night about how siphons work. She didn't understand at all, and I only vaguely do (imagine what that argument was like). But at the end of the debate, I was left with a new question.

If I fill a cup with water in a tub, turn it upside down, and raise it out of the water, keeping the rim submerged, the water doesn't fall out of the cup. My understanding is, the water is being pulled down by gravity, but can't fall because there's nothing to take its place, and it takes a lot of energy to create a vacuum, so the water is simply being held up by the cup, and is exerting some kind of negative pressure on the inside of the cup. When I make a hole in the cup, air can be pulled in to take its place in the cup, so the water can fall.

If I did this experiment in a vacuum, I figure something very similar would happen. The water would be held in the cup until I made a hole, then it would fall into the tub. If anything, the water will fall a little faster, since it doesn't need to do any work to pull air into the cup through the hole. But then it seems that the vacuum is coming in to fill the space, which sounds wrong since the vacuum isn't a thing that moves.

I'm missing something in all of this. Vacuum isn't like air, it doesn't rush in through the hole in the cup to take the place of the water, allowing the water to fall. But then why does making a hole in the cup allow the water to fall?",aggasalk,askscience

"Ask Anything Wednesday - Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science","Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate.

"AskScience AMA Series: We are the Vanderbilt Music Cognition Lab, studying the biological basis of musical and language abilities. Ask Us Anything about musicality, language, brain and genetics! AMA!","We are the [Vanderbilt Music Cognition Lab](https://www.vumc.org/music-cognition-lab/), a research team dedicated to studying the relationship between musical skills and communication skills.  We use tools from psychology, neuroscience, genetics, medicine, and engineering to better understand how and **why humans engage with music** and to what degree musicality interacts with language and social communication. Many of you readers probably have intuitions about [how people with a more ""musical ear"" might have a leg up while learning a new language](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00327/full), or about how musical talent runs in families, or that children's music skills may be affected by the musical environment to which they are exposed.

But did you know that what scientists are learning about music, genetics, and the brain may even be important for our understanding of childhood speech-language development? In 2015 [we showed that children's rhythm skills are predictive of their spoken language skills](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141105101238.htm).  Many studies have also found that people with reading disability and speech problems are more likely to have difficulty with music rhythm. Our [recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1528) reviewed evidence for a new framework about rhythm and speech-language development. Discoveries in this emerging area could help solve an urgent public health problem, which is that many children with language problems are not getting identified or treated!

Alongside this AMA, there is an opportunity to participate in research.

*Do you have good rhythm? Or is rhythm hard for you? All skill levels are welcome! Our new study examines the biological basis of musical rhythm, with an online rhythm test and optional mail-in saliva collection. Participants can choose to receive their rhythm scores at the end of the survey! Participation takes 10-20 minutes. Participants can choose to be entered in a raffle to win a $100 Amazon gift card.*

*Feel free to contact our team at VanderbiltMusicalityResearch@gmail.com with questions. Principal Investigator: Reyna L. Gordon, Ph.D.*

Let's talk about the scientific study of music and language in the brain - Ask Me (us) Anything!


Bios

+ **Reyna Gordon, PhD** (/u/Reyna_Gordon): I am an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where I direct the Music Cognition Lab (/u/VandyMusicCog) and also am on the faculty of the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, the Vanderbilt Brain Institute, and the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center. My research group's interdisciplinary research program is focused on the relationship between rhythm and language abilities from behavioral, cognitive, neural, and genetic perspectives. I am passionate about [training students and staff to work across traditional disciplinary boundaries](https://www.vumc.org/music-cognition-lab/publication/interprofessional-education-next-generation-musician-scientists-through-music-cognition). I hold a PhD in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, and before I became a cognitive neuroscientist, I was a classically trained singer (my Bachelor's degree is in Vocal Arts!).
+ **Eniko Ladanyi, PhD**. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Music Cognition Lab of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I have degrees in linguistics and cognitive science and my current research focuses on associations between rhythm and language skills in typical and atypical speech/language development. I use EEG and behavioral tests to investigate whether rhythm skills at infancy can predict childhood speech/language development and whether children with low speech/language skills also show low rhythm skills. I hope my research will eventually improve screening and therapy of children with speech or language disorders.
+ **Daniel Gustavson, PhD**. I am a Research Instructor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Trained in cognitive psychology and behavior genetics, I use twin studies and measured genetic data to understand how cognitive abilities relate to everyday behaviors such as procrastination, impulsivity, goal management, and (most recently) music engagement. I'm also interested in how our cognitive abilities (like memory and self-control) change over the course of the lifespan, and what types of factors help us improve the most through childhood and keep us most resilient to decline in old age. I play a range of instruments including guitar, drums, and harmonica.
+ **Olivia Boorom MS, CCC-SLP**. (/u/OliviaBoorom) I am a certified speech-language pathologist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Music Cognition Lab. I use behavioral measures to investigate how language and social communication skills relate to rhythmicity, and how the natural rhythms of our daily interactions impact language development in children with Autism spectrum disorder and Developmental Language Disorder. I'm also interested in how music can be used as a tool to support parents and clinicians during everyday activities and during intervention. Before becoming a clinician I was an avid flute player!
+ **Srishti Nayak, PhD.** I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the Music Cognition Lab studying the biological bases of speech rhythms (prosody) and its relationships to musical rhythm and language development. My training is in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience methods, and my work investigates how language environments early in life shape cognitive and neural development. Relatedly, I am interested in how different ""domains"" of cognition - e.g. our attention system or our emotional brain - interact with language. Given my longstanding interest in language as both an environmental *input*, and an *outcome*, my current work investigates bidirectional links between music and language skills, and the possible neural and genetic basis underlying individual variation in these skills.
+ **Anna Kasdan, BS**. I am a third year PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Vanderbilt University. Broadly, I study the neural basis of rhythm in both neurotypical individuals and in individuals with Williams syndrome and aphasia, using neuroimaging techniques such as EEG as well as behavioral measures. I received my undergraduate degree from Boston University, where I majored in Neuroscience and minored in Piano Performance.",AskScienceModerator,askscience

Or is that effective rate dependent upon what it is meant to go after? Or is it based on the person getting the vaccine and how their body accepts it? Or both? None? Other?

AskScience AMA Series: I'm a glaciologist focused on why large outlet glaciers in Greenland are changing. Ask me anything!,"My name is [Michalea King](https://twitter.com/Michalea_King) and I recently completed my PhD in Earth Sciences at the Ohio State University. I am a glaciologist and most of my research focuses on how and why large outlet glaciers in Greenland are changing.

Also answering questions today is [Cassandra Garrison](https://twitter.com/CassLGarrison), a reporter at [Reuters](https://twitter.com/Reuters) who [wrote about one of my latest studies](https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-arctic-idAFL1N2FG1I3). The new study suggests the territory's ice sheet will now gain mass only once every 100 years -- a grim indicator of how difficult it is to re-grow glaciers once they hemorrhage ice. In studying satellite images of the glaciers, our team noted that the glaciers had a 50% chance of regaining mass before 2000, with the odds declining since.

We'll be logging on at noon ET (16 UT), ask us anything!
