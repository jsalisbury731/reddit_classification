14,14,How do I not come off as too eager after the first date?,"M25 just went on a first date with a girl F23. Went to dinner and walked around the city for a bit afterwards and then I left. We hit it off pretty well and we’re trying to plan a 2nd date around our schedules.

So, since I’ve been single for a long time, previous girls I’ve went out with only lasted that one date because whenever I start to like a girl, I want just talk to them all the time. And be with them. But I know that’s why things didn’t work out with previous girls. 

And with this girl, I can feel those same bad habits starting to make their way into my thought process. And I really don’t want to screw this up.

78,78,How do I (M19) explain to my friend (M19) why I hate going to the gym?,"Basically that ^

To start I should probably explain that this guy is like the polar opposite of me, good looking, extroverted, insane sex life, the works - the only thing I think we have in common is liking men 🙄

I have like a massive fear of going to the gym, I can think of nothing more terrifying (except maybe spiders).

The whole exercising thing isn't my forte, the only reason I lost 2 stone was purely by accident, and exercising in front of people is a big fear (stemming from some real shitty experiences when a kid etc.). I not only lost far but like almost any muscle I had. 

I can barely run or jog without some form of massive worry that everybody else there is judging both my technique, and how shitty my looks are.

And as for any form of weights? That's just as bad - I can barely squat 15 kg. And all I can ever think of is that I somehow used to be able to deadlift 100kg just from like farm work. 

Then to top it all I seem to have some form of SAD which genuinely fucks me up mentally most of winter and start of spring. 

I have literally no idea how to explain this to my guy friend, who is the lost extroverted person I know (that literally deadlift/throw my entire body weight across a room) and is like permenately happy and the polar opposite of me.

The idea of actually saying this in person is like horrifying - I don't want to break his bubble where he can only see the world as some fuckin good place where introverts don't exist - and I'd probably just stutter on every other friggin word... 

I'm sure he'd be proper weirded out if he clocked how much of an introvert I actually am.

154,154,Why doesn’t my boyfriend care about my pleasure?,"Hi guys, I have a bit of a predicament and I was hoping you could help me.

I (23F) have been dating my bf (33M) for about 2 1/2 years now. He is the most loving, giving, affectionate man in every aspect besides sex.  I know that he loves having sex with me..but he only wants to have sex like once a week..barely.  For instance the last time we had sex was over two weeks ago, and then I got my period. Towards the end of my period I gave him a REALLY good blow job. Last night, I was joking around and said how horny I was bc we hadn’t had sex in two weeks..he turned and looked at me and said, “yes we did, you gave me a bj a few days ago” !!!!!

The main problem is that he never ever goes down on me or fingers me beyond like shoving his fingers in me to get me ready for sex.  During sex it’s like he forgets that I need my clit stimulated so the only time I cum is when I’m on top. I was insecure about this for a long time that maybe I taste bad or something, but it can’t be because my ex’s before would beg me to sit on their face. And I would cum in every single position. My bf is older than me and more dominant so when I do try and tell him what to do, I feel like it’s a turn off for him. 

Anytime I bring this up to him it’s like a blow to his ego. I try not bringing it up and try things like, dressing up sexy which I did two nights ago. We even bought rope and some cuffs to play with and haven’t even opened it yet. That was 2 months ago. But nothing seems to work.

171,171,Why don't guys include their pronouns on social media bios?,"Honest question, not a secret postmodern cultural Marxist here to steal your testosterone.


Almost every cisgender woman I know has recently added ""she/her"" to their social media bios. I understand why that movement is taking place  for people who may be misgendered/""clocked"", but it seems a bit redundant for most cisgender people and it's seems to be purely a solidarity thing.



But **zero** guys I know have done the same. Most people I know support that whole movement, but none have considered proactively sharing their pronouns.


Why is that?

Does the thought just not cross the mind?

My pet theory is that guys know damn well no-one is looking at our Instagram pages anyway except our mothers.",Tundur,AskMen,1,"why don't guys include their pronouns on social media bios? honest question, not a secret postmodern cultural marxist here to steal your testosterone.


almost every cisgender woman i know has recently added ""she/her"" to their social media bios. i understand why that movement is taking place  for people who may be misgendered/""clocked"", but it seems a bit redundant for most cisgender people and it's seems to be purely a solidarity thing.



but **zero** guys i know have done the same. most people i know support that whole movement, but none have considered proactively sharing their pronouns.


why is that?

does the thought just not cross the mind?

191,191,Am not sure how i feel anymore,"
Am in the late thirties, not soft in real life by any mean and here is a part of me i want to share with u. 

Its started 9 years ago. I met her in a bar were she was working. I couldn’t take my eyes off here. Asked her out and later she handed over her number and then we started dating. 

We spent together 1.5 years. I loved her so much. I knew back then it was the one, you know the one love comes in ur life only once. I was getting stomach butterflies every time i was seeing her. I have done things in my life i never thought i would ever do because of her. The problem is, she was so pretty. I mean very pretty to the point anyone sees her they can’t stop complementing her beauty. That includes women too. 
Tbh it was exhausting, i mean i start to get jealous. And she was the kinds of flirty person. I remember She opened up to me one night while we were drunk and said that’s part of her culture and this how women keep the man interested. But it was too much for me as it affected my trust in her at some point. 

During the time we were together i declared to her how am serious about us. I let her meet my sister as she was living in a nearby city(we both expats).  I talked with her about parenting and how much i really love kids and i wish they look like her. I did everything i could to make her happy. And i mean literary everything i could from time/care/traveling/money/etc. things were going normal with ups and downs like any relationship. 

One day my work asked me to go on a business trip for 3 months. Deep down i know that it will be a very difficult time specially after the last few weeks as she lost her job and she wasn’t sure about what she want do for living. 

So i left and we were texting/talking like almost everyday. Exactly after 2 weeks i called her and i was checking how she feels because she was so down looking for a job and failing in a lot of interviews, then she said she is with her friend and she will go to sleep because she is so tired. For some reason i called again later that night and when she answered she said she is with some people in car and going somewhere to party. At that time she had no money (i gave her some and rented a place for her) and she was suppose to prepare for an interview the next day. 

That was the moment i realized that she can’t take responsibilities. I felt i was caring too much. I was giving too much without much in return. I know this is how most people describe love but I didn’t really feel i was fair to myself. If she didn’t care about herself then what am doing then. So i broke up with her at that call. 

My birthday was exactly after 1 week from that call. I was hoping from the bottom of my heart that things gets better. She texted me: MYNAME! 
That’s it. And i never heard from her again or saw single text. 

I won’t lie to you. It broke me to pieces although it was my decision. I lost a piece of me back then. She left and took something with her that after all this years am not able to get back. 

I tried to make my self busy. Tried to learn how to play music and it didn’t work out. Then i started doing photography and i realized everyone is telling me that my pictures are great and different and i should consider photography as a thing in my life. From there i learned how to do it professionally and i became one of the best photographer in town(glamour and beauty). I met a lot of beautiful/hot girls. I went to parties and i had a lot of connections easily. Photography was a way for me to sink myself into a new life. I didn’t do it as a full time job although everyone was telling me to. But i didn’t want to sacrifice my career (i have a decent one) and i kept it as a hobby and enjoyment of making something beautiful. 

During that period i had an open relationship with someone. We agreed that it’s just a casual thing and i made myself clear that am not looking for anything serious or a relationship. She agreed and It went ok for a year and unfortunately the girl has developed emotion during that period and she start to make future plans for us so i decided to end it before it gets even worth as I didn’t want to hurt her(although i know i did). I didn’t feel anything towards her. I felt like am dead inside with every girl i met over the years. I was even usually  using alcohol (I couldn’t with it) whenever am spending a night with anyone to enjoy my time and feel good. 

I decided i will stop photography and all these relationship thing and focus about my work. I became less social. I lost some of my friends as i don’t party anymore. And the other ones either left the country or moved to another city(yeah welcome to the expat’s life, sucks).  I don’t enjoy the booz anymore (u know signs of getting old). And things went super quit in my life. 

Till one day 2 years back i got a very long message from my ex (first one i talked about) mentioning how grateful she is towards everything i did for her and how she admires every moment we spent together from anger to true love and in conclusion she wanted to thank me for everything things i did for her and apologize if she ever did hurt me. 

Tbh the moment i got the message i though i would react differently but i was ok. Seems that i was over her! or i forgot about her! or my mind couldn’t process it! Tbh am not really sure. Anyhow i texted her back thanking her and ask if she still in town we might go for a coffee as it’s been so many years. And her answer confused me till today: she said that she don’t think it’s a good idea plus she is in a relationship and she doesn’t want to tell her boyfriend that she is going to meet her ex for a coffee. I replied i understand and take care. 

I know it’s really a very long rant and i know a lot of people might not understand and feel it the same way i do as there is so many to say and tell in between but that would be too long for a post on Reddit. But i have been going through my past in the last few months (thanks covid)trying to sort my thoughts and see the mistakes i have done in my life so i don’t repeat them or at least i reach to a point to know how i can make my life better and happier. 

My ex image extensively is been hunting me recently and every time it comes up i really don’t know where its coming from. And the message i got from her 2 years back keep raising questions i have no answer for. Did she mean anything by that? Am i still doomed and living in her memories and the past? Why her profile pic is still the pic i took 8 years back ? Can i get the old me again please? I miss feeling things the way they used to feel. 

Please forgive me, first for my English as its not my main language and second for this long post.  I really needed to get this out of my chest. I couldn’t tell this to the people i know. And I couldn’t even post this from my real account.
